The University of Alberta has also made adjustments to admissions-related deadlines and document requirements. The admissions practice changes are designed to provide students with a sense of reassurance that these disruptions, which are outside of their control, will not negatively impact their application and enrolment at the U of A.</p>\n<p>While these changes address many of the concerns and challenges we are hearing, weâ€™d also like to reassure applicants, their families, and school counsellors that reasonable accommodations will be made for applicants whose learning environments have been disrupted.</p>\n<p>These admissions practice changes aim to ensure that the academic changes and disruptions in global education systems that have accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic do not disadvantage applicants to University of Alberta programs, and ensure all applicants are treated in a fair and equitable manner.</p>\n<p>Calculation of Admission GPA - University of Alberta Students</p>\n<p>For current post-secondary students applying to an undergraduate or graduate program, grades issued by the University of Alberta for courses taken in Winter 2020 will not be included in the calculation of admission GPAs.</p>\n<p>A University of Alberta grade of CR from Winter 2020 will contribute to the credit requirements for admission and will be accepted as satisfying program prerequisites. A grade of NC will not contribute to credit requirements for admission and will not satisfy program prerequisites.</p>\n<p>This is the process that will be followed for applications that are in progress, and any future University of Alberta applications that include the revised Winter 2020 grading scheme.</p>\n<p>Calculation of Admission GPA - External Post-Secondary Students</p>\n<p>For external post-secondary students applying to an undergraduate or graduate program at the University of Alberta, grades for courses taken in Winter 2020 will not be included in the calculation of admission GPAs.</p>\n<p>Passing grades from Winter 2020 will contribute to the credit requirements for individual admissions, provided the grades meet the threshold required for transfer credit as outlined in the University Calendar, and will be accepted as satisfying program prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Non-passing grades from Winter 2020 will not contribute to the credit requirements for individual admissions and will not be accepted as satisfying program prerequisites.</p>\n<p>Documentation/Final Marks</p>\n<p>If an applicant (domestic or international) to an undergraduate or graduate program at the university is unable to provide final documentation due to school closures or exam cancellations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the University of Alberta will accept the grades and existing interim documents presented at the time of their initial offer as meeting the requirements to clear individual admission conditions.</p>\n<p>English Language Proficiency (ELP)</p>\n<p>The Duolingo English Test will be made available to all applicants to undergraduate and graduate programs as an additional option to demonstrate English Language Proficiency for Spring 2020, Summer 2020, Fall 2020, and Winter 2021 admission.</p>\n<p>Tuition Deposit Deadline</p>\n<p>The deadline for applicants to pay their tuition deposit has been extended from May 1, 2020 to June 1, 2020. Students can begin registering in courses once their tuition deposit is received and processed.</p>\n<p>For additional information for students applying to the University of Alberta, please visit our page on this website for</p>\n<p>Frequently Asked Questions for Academic Changes</p>\n<p>.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 06, 2020","title":"Update on Changes to Admissions for the Fall 2020 Term","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ualberta.ca/covid-19/updates/04/2020-04-06-changes-to-admissions-for-fall-2020.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e32b74c3-d6ba-53bb-83c2-f00e52f27811"}}}

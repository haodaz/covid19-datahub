We will not be holding in-person ceremonies this June and instead will move to a virtual convocation to celebrate all that they have achieved. This will be a different experience than we were anticipating and a different approach than we have seen in our 112-year history. However we look forward to creating a memorable online moment for our Class of 2020 and our university community.</p>\n<p>Please mark June 12, 2020 in your calendars as the new online Spring 2020 convocation date. We will provide details as they become available.</p>\n<p>We also look forward to welcoming our graduates back to the University of Alberta campus at an in-person ceremony, when it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p>As the Class of 2020 joins our global community of alumni, we remain hopeful, knowing that they bring a unique set of skills honed by this crisis that will positively impact our communities and institutions in the future. They have already contributed in innumerable ways on our campuses, and we know they will continue that success wherever they go next. The world needs our graduates and we know they are ready to contribute.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>President David H. Turpin and Chancellor Douglas Stollery</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 02, 2020","title":"Spring Convocation: The U of A will celebrate the Class of 2020 virtually","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ualberta.ca/covid-19/updates/04/2020-04-02-changes-to-spring-2020-convocation.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"530c27c9-9139-509c-827b-20369eb1b3fc"}}}

However, where assessment is heavily impacted by the current situation (such as health placement courses), grading in some courses may change to become Pass/Fail. You can read more about this decision and what this means for you <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&#x26;2=24689\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Withdrawal Without Academic Penalty (WWAP): This has been extended until 2 days after the end of the official examinations period (13th July 2020). If you sit your exams and then make an informed decision about withdrawing there will be no academic penalty prior to grade release, and you will receive a grade of ‘W’ (= withdrawn) which will not affect your GPA.</li>\n<li>Assessment extensions / exam deferrals: You may not need a medical certificate; you can provide a statement outlining your circumstances. See details on the student FAQ tab <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wo8Dv8S~xb~Gv9m~yK_Jv8p~y77Mv~W~z7~Pv8f&#x26;2=24690\">here</a>.</li>\n<li>Free student software for personal use: If you use specialist software on-campus at our UQ computer labs, you can now access many of these applications remotely for free.

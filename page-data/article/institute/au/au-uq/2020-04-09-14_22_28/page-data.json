As you would be aware, during the week the Australian Government upgraded its travel ban to Level 4 prohibiting all international travel for Australians and banning all foreign nationals from entering Australia due to the coronavirus pandemic.  </p>\n<p>The Government has also strengthened its health response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including introducing further restrictions to indoor gatherings. Unfortunately, these measures will make it incredibly difficult to continue with many of our face-to-face teaching activities and some aspects of campus life.</p>\n<p>This Semester is going to be different for all of us - but we are doing everything we can to make sure you keep progressing with your study and make the most of this challenging situation.</p>\n<p><strong>Teaching activities</strong></p>\n<p>We have made the difficult and complex decision to move all teaching activities online for Semester 1 from Monday 23 March 2020. Please be assured, we want to give you as much certainty as currently possible so that you can continue your studies even if that means adjustment to teaching arrangements and term dates.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em><strong>What will go online:</strong></em>  All learning experiences - lectures, seminars, tutorials, labs and practicals - will be available online where possible. Some essential knowledge and skills cannot be learnt online, and your programs will be adjusted to ensure you gain these prior to graduation. Student support services will also be available online. Please regularly check your course Blackboard sites and your UQ email for changes.</li>\n<li><em><strong>Your timetable:</strong></em>  Your courses will run as previously scheduled unless advised by your Course Coordinator.</li>\n<li><em><strong>What this means for assessment</strong></em> : Course Coordinators are reviewing assessment. For courses that are delivered fully online, there will be no requirement to attend campus for assessment in Semester 1. Please check your course Blackboard site for details. Your Electronic Course Profile (ECP) will be revised and your Course Coordinator will let you know when this is available.</li>\n<li><em><strong>What this means for the academic calendar</strong></em> : With the pause in teaching this week, additional time for teaching and learning activities has been scheduled at the end of the semester.  This will result in a change to examinations and postponing graduation ceremonies. Students who meet their program requirements will still have their degrees conferred after the finalisation of Semester 1.

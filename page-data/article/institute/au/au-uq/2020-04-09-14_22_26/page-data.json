Please consider carefully whether you have been engaged with the course learning activities before adding courses.  </p>\n<p> <strong>How can I enrol in my courses for Semester 1?</strong></p>\n<p>We have more than 99 per cent of our courses available online. Please follow the steps below to enrol via mySI-net:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Log in to <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wrCDv8S~xb~Gv9m~yJTJv8o~y77Mv~w~z7~Pv85&#x26;2=24395\">my.UQ Dashboard</a> and select 'mySI-net' from the side menu.</li>\n<li>\n<p>From the mySI-net home page: </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Go to 'Enrolments' > 'Enrolment Summary' > 'Add Course'.</li>\n<li>Type in a course code and check details (campus, location, semester).</li>\n<li>Go to 'Add Course'.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Repeat these steps to enrol in your other courses.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We understand you may not be able to take on a full-time study load, and you may want to opt for a part-time study load instead. This will not change your student visa status but it may extend the time that it takes to complete your degree. If you do require additional time to complete your studies (beyond your visa expiry), you will need to apply for a new student visa.</p>\n<p>There is a very small number of courses that you cannot enrol in via mySI-net.  Contact Student Services <a href=\"mailto:student.services@uq.edu.au\">student.services@uq.edu.au</a> or +61 (07) 3365 1704 for assistance with these courses.</p>\n<p>If you have trouble accessing your username and password to log into UQ systems, please contact <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wrCDv8S~xb~Gv9m~yJTJv8o~y77Mv~w~z7~Pv85&#x26;2=24396\">IT services</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Can I access online content from China?</strong></p>\n<p>Course content can be accessed via your course Blackboard.

Students are advised to maintain records of their communication with UQ to provide to the CSCSE that verifies that they have indeed been impacted by the COVID-19 situation.</p>\n<p><strong>How will this impact assessments, exams and key academic dates?</strong></p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://support.my.uq.edu.au/rd?1=AvNS~wrCDv8S~xb~Gv9m~yJTJv8o~y77Mv~w~z7~Pv85&#x26;2=24399\">University Calendar</a> has been updated to reflect the new dates.  There will be no requirement to attend campus for assessments or exams in Semester 1.</p>\n<p>If you have missed assessments or exams your Course Coordinator will work with you to make up course work and reschedule key activities.</p>\n<p><strong>If I re-enrol in a course, will I still have a chance to drop the course or interrupt my study before Census Date of 31 March 2020?</strong></p>\n<p>If you re-enrol in your courses before 11.59pm on Wednesday 25th March, you will have 6 days to try your course online.  You are able to drop your courses without financial penalty until 31 March.

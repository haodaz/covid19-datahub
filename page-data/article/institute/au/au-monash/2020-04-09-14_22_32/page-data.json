These events have not yet been scheduled, and will be subject to health and travel advice. The date and time of your replacement event will be communicated in August.</li>\n<li>Despite the deferral of upcoming graduation ceremonies, students can still be conferred in May if they're eligible (course completed and not encumbered). Students will receive access to official digital copies of their award certificate (testamur), academic record (transcript) and Australian Higher Education Graduation Statement (AHEGS) in mid-May. The hardcopy award certificate will be made available following, whether or not students plan to attend an event later this year.</li>\n<li>Alternatively, students can opt to graduate in the September/October ceremony round at Clayton.

This will be followed by the Easter break and scheduled mid-semester break from April 15 to 17.</p>\n<p>“This will provide staff with two weeks to adapt more fully to online teaching, with the extra week of teaching made up at the end of semester to guarantee students receive the full 12 weeks of semester,” Professor den Hollander said.</p>\n<p>“Solutions are well advanced to provide robust online examinations and to ensure fair and equitable assessment processes for our students.</p>\n<p>“I recognise the agile and innovative efforts of staff across all areas of the University to move our operations and teaching into the virtual environment in such a short time.</p>\n<p>“As a University committed to truth and to research-informed decision-making, we have maintained a calm and evidence-based approach to inform our response to the virus and carefully consider how best to keep our students and staff healthy and safe.</p>\n<p>“Our response to this unprecedented situation exemplifies UWA’s well-embedded tradition of endeavour and commitment to finding solutions to current challenges.”</p>\n<p>Media references</p>\n<p>Simone Hewett (UWA Media &#x26; PR Manager) 08 6488 3229/0432 637 716</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 27, 2020","title":"UWA moves quickly to online learning","tags":null,"link":"http://www.news.uwa.edu.au/2020032711940/students/uwa-moves-quickly-online-learning"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"223f17e0-602d-53b0-ae3d-a34cdc2d2aaf"}}}

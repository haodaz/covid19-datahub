I can’t emphasise enough how important it is that you get vaccinated. In fact, the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners is urging Australians to get their flu vaccination as soon as possible to reduce strain on the health system caused by COVID-19.</p>\n<p>The flu vaccine can help to protect you, your family and the community from infection, helping to keep us healthy to continue with our new lives, including your studies.</p>\n<p>In short:</p>\n<p>Assessment guidelines for Semester One</p>\n<p>Online exam software</p>\n<p>University Medical Centre remains open</p>\n<p>Flu vaccinations</p>\n<p>Self-help website toolkit</p>\n<p>Updated Semester One 2020 teaching timetable</p>\n<p>Assessment guidelines for Semester One</p>\n<p>Some students have expressed concern around exams and assessment. We previously guaranteed your exams and assessments for all units will be delivered online or remotely. This disruption to assessment methods will impact on individual students differently, and we have therefore put guidelines in place to ensure fair and equitable assessment.</p>\n<p>The following process will apply to our undergraduate coursework units that are not part of professionally accredited courses:</p>\n<p>Students will complete their assessments and exams online or remotely</p>\n<p>Students will receive their final grade</p>\n<p>Students who have passed the unit can then choose to accept their grade OR accept an ungraded pass</p>\n<p>An Ungraded Pass will mean that students can opt out of having their marks for the semester (or for individual units) contribute towards their weighted average mark (WAM).</p>\n<p>I believe this recognises the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in and enables you to have some certainty about the outcome.</p>\n<p>Please note:</p>\n<p>Units that form part of professionally accredited courses will need to ensure their assessments align with accreditation (or revised accreditation) requirements</p>\n<p>Honours and postgraduate units (and select undergraduate units) may have differing assessment guidelines</p>\n<p>Assessment methods will differ by unit but may include online exams, oral exams (viva voce), continuous assessment or an ungraded pass</p>\n<p>Semester One exams will commence on Saturday 6 June</p>\n<p>Online exam software</p>\n<p>The University is in the processes of procuring Examplify, an assessment program developed and licensed by ExamSoft. This program allows students to securely sit examinations remotely downloaded to their devices (both Windows and Mac). Access to the Internet is only required to download or upload the exam but not required while completing the exam. The software includes features to ensure academic integrity.</p>\n<p>More information for academic staff and students on technical requirements, as well as an FAQ page, will be available soon.</p>\n<p>University Medical Centre remains open</p>\n<p>The Medical Centre on campus remains open, providing their regular services through face-to-face visits or Telehealth consultations. Telehealth consultations reduce the risk of exposure to both patients and Medical Centre staff and doctors.</p>\n<p>The Government recently announced an extension to Telehealth appointments which can be bulk-billed through Medicare until 30 September 2020. International students who hold Overseas Student Health Cover are also eligible for Telehealth through their OSHC provider. To book an appointment call 08 6488 2118 or book online.</p>\n<p>Flu vaccinations</p>\n<p>The UWA Medical Centre is offering flu vaccines in an outdoor clinic from today, Wednesday 1 April.</p>\n<p>To book an appointment, call 08 6488 2118 or book online.

Identifying ways to manage stress and engaging in strategies to support yourself will help with your mental health and wellbeing. Take a look at the Supporting You online self-help toolkit which provides a number of tips and resources for taking care of yourself.</p>\n<p>Updated Semester One 2020 teaching timetable</p>\n<p>With the addition of the tuition free week that’s commencing on Monday 6 April, you can view the updated Semester One 2020 teaching timetable.</p>\n<p>The timetable maintains 12 teaching weeks, the study breaks and two weeks of exams. Exams will commence on Saturday 6 June and best endeavours will be made for all to be completed in a timely manner. Your personal exam timetable is published five weeks before the exam period (from 4 May) on studentConnect.</p>\n<p>For units in Non-Standard Teaching Periods your Unit Coordinator will advise of any changes to the teaching timetable and assessment.</p>\n<p>I am so pleased so many of you are hanging in and continuing with your studies. It’s a strange time but I am sure that when we are through this we will all be measured by our ability to adapt to our changed circumstances. My hope is we all will come out the other side together, stronger and with more understanding about the world and how we treat each other. Keep being kind and generous, it really does matter.</p>\n<p>Please continue to send your feedback and questions to vice-chancellor@uwa.edu.au so I can remain updated on your concerns.</p>\n<p>Speak soon.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Jane and Bre</p>\n<p>Professor Jane den Hollander AO</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>\n<p>Bre Shanahan</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>UWA Student Guild</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellery • M464, Perth WA 6009 Australia</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"COVID-19 student email 1 April 2020","tags":null,"link":"http://theuniversityofwesternaustralia.newsweaver.com/10vv51er7f/1sn4bz7vthv?email=true&lang=en&a=11&p=4347368"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"55401e6b-423d-5230-854f-37381671ab79"}}}

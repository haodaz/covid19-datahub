These measures are informed by NSW Health and eliminate ‘close contact’ and therefore decreases risks relating to the spread of the virus.    </p>\n<p>A ‘close contact’ is someone who has been face-to-face for at least 15 minutes or has been in the same closed space for at least two hours, as someone who has tested positive for the COVID-19 when that person was infectious.    </p>\n<p>Depending on a subject’s requirements, social distancing measures for in-person learning includes:  </p>\n<ul>\n<li>relocating class to a larger teaching space,  </li>\n<li>increasing the distance between people in class, and </li>\n<li>increased cleaning and disinfecting of surfaces. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>As the situation continues to evolve, it is important to stay up to date with the expert advice from NSW Health. As new information becomes available, we will also be updating our FAQs page and reviewing current social distancing measures. While you may be feeling increased anxiety and uncertainty, please be assured that we are doing all that we can to keep you safe. </p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 23, 2020","title":"Announcements","tags":null,"link":"https://www.uts.edu.au/current-students/news/coronavirus-and-international-travel-information"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f823318a-5b53-5ff0-a299-a483b71c14ca"}}}

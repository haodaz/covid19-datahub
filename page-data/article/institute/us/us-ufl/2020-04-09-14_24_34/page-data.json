Spring 2020 courses for which the student earns an S grade will be accepted as meeting requirements for the degree (e.g., for general education, writing, or major requirements.). Please note the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Neither S nor U grades calculate into the GPA.</li>\n<li>Students must earn the equivalent of a C grade or better in the course to earn an S.</li>\n<li>A grade equivalent to a C- or lower will earn a U, which does not earn credit toward the degree.</li>\n<li>Once a student elects the S-U option, they cannot revert to a letter grade.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Students will also be allowed to drop any Spring 2020 course with a W.  No courses dropped in this process will count against the student’s current lower division or upper division drop count.  Students will be fee-liable for courses dropped. Students will not be able to drop all courses in this process and would, rather, follow the <a href=\"https://registrar.ufl.edu/services/withdrawals.html\">UF Withdrawal Process</a>. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The window of time in which students can request S-U grading or to drop a course will be <strong>April 1-April 22, 2020</strong>. </li>\n<li>The drop/withdrawal deadline has been <strong>shifted from April 10 to April 22, 2020</strong>. </li>\n<li>All requests will be made through an online form that will be available on each student’s ONE.UF page <strong>starting April 1, 2020</strong>. </li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 25, 2020","title":"S-U GRADING AND DROP POLICY UPDATE","tags":null,"link":"http://undergrad.aa.ufl.edu/for-students/covid-19-and-academic-policies/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"76496be7-df62-51ed-a400-e7834e41c1cd"}}}

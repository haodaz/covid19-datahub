If you have technical issues, please reach out to CCIT support at IThelp@clemson.edu.</p>\n<p>RESEARCH OPERATIONS</p>\n<p>The modified operations of the University have brought about several questions about research work at Clemson. We have attempted to answer those questions as best as possible with the current information available on our COVID-19 Research Continuity webpage found on the Clemson COVID website. As the situation continues to evolve, the page will be updated as new information becomes available.</p>\n<p>Issued by University Relations</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 18, 2020","title":"COVID-19 update, 03/18/20 – CU Safe Alerts","tags":null,"link":"https://alerts.clemson.edu/2020/03/18/covid-19-update-03-18-20/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"44b9486d-be1a-5442-97e4-e1e553aa5398"}}}

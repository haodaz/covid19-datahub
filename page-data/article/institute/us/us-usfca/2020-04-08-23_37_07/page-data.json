Please note that students will have the ability to make this decision only during a one-week window after final letter grades are posted at the end of the semester by their instructors. Some classes will be exempt from this policy, and students are strongly advised to consult with their academic advisers and other faculty before making decisions. (This policy does not apply to students in the School of Law, as the law school will be communicating with its students separately.) Please review the full policy carefully. More details regarding exceptions, considerations, and the implementation process will be posted in the next few weeks.</p>\n<p>I am keenly aware that the disruptions of the semester, including classes being moved online and students abruptly having to move off campus, have been incredibly stressful. We are all affected in different ways. USF is deeply committed to caring for the whole person, or cura personalis, and so it is my hope that having the option to elect a Pass (P) grade helps alleviate some anxiety. The well-being of each and every member of the USF community is what matters most and so we are doing everything possible to be flexible, to listen, to be patient, and to support one another during this time.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about grading options, please reach out to your academic adviser, faculty, or dean’s office.</p>\n<p>Best,</p>\n<p>Tyrone H. Cannon</p>\n<p>Interim Provost and Vice President of Academic Affairs</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Update on Grading Policy for the Spring 2020 Semester","tags":null,"link":"https://myusf.usfca.edu/announcement/update-grading-policy-spring-2020-semester"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"703c1be5-cc4b-563b-b5c6-8bd339ebe43b"}}}

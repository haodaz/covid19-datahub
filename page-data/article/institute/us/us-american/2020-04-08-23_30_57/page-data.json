Recently, the U.S. federal government issues new guidance in response to the situation. The University has posted a new resource document on the Student Health Center website, including information about the new guidance, frequently asked questions, and links to updates from U.S. health agencies including the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the DC Department of Health. We encourage the community to review these resources. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and any further guidance from U.S. health authorities and provide updates to the community.</p>\n<p>If you have additional questions about 2019 Novel Coronavirus, please email the Studen Health Center at shc@american.edu.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>David Reitman</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Febraury 3 Coronavirus update","tags":null,"link":"https://www.american.edu/ocl/healthcenter/feb3-coronavirus.cfm"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"02f34f1a-b2d6-5f94-a5ab-8ff82331f459"}}}

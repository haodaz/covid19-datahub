The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has caused concern in the College community, and a great deal of disruption in our country, city and on our campus.</p>\n<p>The College has been diligently working to move into this new set of realities with your health and safety central to everything we do. In that vein, here is information that I hope will be helpful for you.</p>\n<p>Many of you are wondering how final exams will be administered, since the news to move to online classes during Spring Quarter. While exam week will continue as planned, your final exams will be administered and evaluated online or through other remote mediums, such as take-home exams. This will help us to maintain the national guidelines for social distancing, enabling you to take your exams safely while preserving the integrity of the coursework you have done through the Winter Quarter.</p>\n<p>If you have questions regarding your final exam, please be in touch with your instructors. For all other academic questions, please reach out to your academic adviser.</p>\n<p>Best wishes for a successful exam week.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jay Ellison, PhD</p>\n<p>Dean of Students</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"UChicago College Email Update (Mar.13)","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirusupdates.uchicago.edu/mar-13-college-email-update/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c2365803-79bd-5d57-a2b3-a4490febf8ab"}}}

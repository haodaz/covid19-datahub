Based on your feedback, the University has decided to extend the deadline to switch to Pass/No Credit grading from the last day of classes, Saturday, May 9, to the last day of finals, Wednesday, May 20. This date will also be the new deadline to withdraw from a class. Please be advised that most programs in the Schools of Dental Medicine, Health Technology and Management, Medicine, Nursing, and Social Welfare will not participate in P/NC grading or in the withdrawal extension.</p>\n<p>A message to students concerning grading policy for the current semester has been issued by Charles L. Robbins, Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education and Dean, Undergraduate Colleges. The message reads as follows:</p>\n<p>We recognize that this semester is unlike any other and has created a great deal of anxiety and confusion. The purpose of this communication is to clarify some of the issues regarding grading for the Spring 2020. Please keep in mind that these changes are in effect for only the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>All classes that began the semester with a grading scale of A – F or S/U will continue with it. Rather than the GPNC system that you are used to, we are moving forward with a Pass/No Credit option for this semester. As is currently true with GPNC, schools and colleges will have the opportunity to opt out of the Pass/No Credit option.</p>\n<p>If permitted by their program, students will have the chance to designate if they want a grade or Pass/No Credit. There is no limit on the number of courses that can be designated Pass/No Credit. This designation must be made no later than the last day of the classes, Saturday May 9, 2020.</p>\n<p>All grades of ‘C’ or better will be considered a Pass.</p>\n<p>For this semester, a Pass will satisfy both SBC and Major requirements. As is true for GPNC, faculty will not know which students adopt the Pass/No Credit option Schools and colleges will notify students by March 30th, the day classes resume, if students will be able to take the Pass/No Credit option. This change is intended to support your academic success and increase the flexibility available to you.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, please reach out to your faculty, professional advisor or major advisor.</p>\n<p>Wishing you the best as we resume the semester.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 24, 2020","title":"University Issues Information on Grading Policy for Current Semester","tags":null,"link":"https://news.stonybrook.edu/academics/university-issues-information-on-grading-policy-for-current-semester/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"49b11a35-b1dd-591e-897e-9809700920c4"}}}

Yes, our challenges are great as we progress through the spring semester – together and united – but every day we are encouraged and inspired by all of you. Baylor Faculty truly are special, and we might add exceptional, in your dedication to our students and our Christian mission. From maintaining live “office” hours and conducting regular student wellness checks to adjusting time zones to support the learning of our international students, you are not only going above and beyond, but simply doing what Baylor Faculty do. For this, we thank you.</p>\n<p>Today we jointly want to provide two significant faculty-focused updates, based on our collaborative work and in recognition of the many professional and personal disruptions you have faced this semester due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Course Evaluations</p>\n<p>Student course evaluations for the spring semester will not be used as part of the annual evaluation process nor as a mandated part of the promotion and tenure dossier. Instead, results from student course evaluations will be provided only to the individual faculty member so that they may use this feedback as a way of improving their online instruction. Since this is the first time most of our faculty have taught online, soliciting feedback from students is important. Let us assure you that these student evaluations are instructive for you only, and you will not be harmed by the swift change to an unfamiliar pedagogy.</p>\n<p>For the University to learn from this period of online instruction, we will review the student course evaluation data only in the aggregate. Furthermore, we also will ask the faculty for feedback on how we, as the Administration and Faculty Senate, can improve in supporting your teaching in an online environment.</p>\n<p>Tenure Clock</p>\n<p>All current tenure-track faculty will be granted a one-year extension to their respective tenure clocks. Any of these faculty may decline this one-year extension, but in order to do so, faculty currently in Years 1-4 must “opt out” by informing their department chair, dean, and Vice Provost Jim Bennighof in an email message by July 31, 2020 that they are declining the extension.</p>\n<p>Faculty in Year 5 (who are currently scheduled for Tenure Review during the 2020-21 academic year) who wish to decline the tenure clock extension must do so in the same way by May 15, 2020. We encourage these faculty to notify their department chair, dean, and Vice Provost Bennighof via email as soon as possible so as to facilitate the timely pursuit of the process (especially the solicitation of external review letters).</p>\n<p>Faculty who receive the tenure clock extension will not undergo formal annual tenure-track reviews during the 2020-21 academic year. Instead, these reviews will be held in the 2021-22 academic year.</p>\n<p>Assessment of work done during this period of disruption will follow the principles stated in Section III.F of the Tenure Policy with regard to extensions to the tenure time limit.</p>\n<p>Any faculty member seeking advice about whether to opt out of this extension should consult with the chair of his or her department. Questions about the process should be directed to Vice Provost Bennighof at James_Bennighof@baylor.edu.</p>\n<p>In Closing</p>\n<p>The decisions related to these important issues reflect the collaborative work of the deans, vice provosts and Faculty Senate, with the support of the President’s Council. As President Livingstone communicated last week, the University faces many unknowns in the weeks and months ahead. One thing that’s certain, however, is the appreciation we have for our faculty and your service to Baylor and her students.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 31, 2020","title":"Faculty updates on course evaluations, tenure clock","tags":null,"link":"http://www.baylor.edu/provost/news.php?action=story&story=218279"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2c4f59d7-f9ce-5c1b-bceb-66fb2727ec17"}}}

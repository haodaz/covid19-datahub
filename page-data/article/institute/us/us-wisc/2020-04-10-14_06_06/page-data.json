More details are now available on the Office of the Registrar website.</p>\n<p>This option applies to undergraduate, graduate, capstone, and special students. Law, Medicine, PharmD and Vet Med students should consult forthcoming guidance provided by their Dean.</p>\n<p>At the end of the Spring 2020 term, instructors will submit a standard grade to the Office of the Registrar. After the grade is received, students may choose to convert their letter grade in any course to one of two new grades: SD (Satisfactory-Disruption) and UD (Unsatisfactory-Disruption). The SD grade will count for all University General Education, degree/major, certificate, and PhD minor requirements and will satisfy future course prerequisites. The UD will not count for any credit. Neither of the new grades will be included in GPA calculations.</p>\n<p>Please visit the website for more information, including an FAQ. More information will be added, so remember to refresh the page each time you visit for the most updated information.</p>\n<p>Students, please talk to your advisor if you have questions about whether to use this option.</p>\n<p>Instructors, if you have questions, please contact Instructional Continuity.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your continued patience, flexibility and dedication to teaching and learning at this unprecedented time.</p>\n<p>Karl Scholz</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>University of Wisconsin–Madison</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 10, 7557","title":"Spring semester grading: More details announced","tags":null,"link":"https://covid19.wisc.edu/spring-semester-grading-more-details-announced/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1397fd52-a858-5777-8daa-cecd130476fb"}}}

Here are some tips from IT for getting the most out of your technology:\nZoom works best with a strong internet signal, particularly when teaching. If you have a slow signal, your video or the other participants’ videos will freeze or buffer and it might be hard to hear. </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use a wired, not a wireless connection. That is, attach your computer via an ethernet cord to the router if possible. </li>\n<li>If connecting from a laptop, plug in to wall power. Battery use can adversely affect video quality. </li>\n<li>If you don’t have an ethernet cord (and you are not able to get one now), you have to maximize the Wi-Fi signal. To do so:\no\tLocate your router and move it to the center of the house or apartment.\nKeep it off the floor and out of any closets.\no\tDownload the app Wi-Fi SweetSpots (Apple or Android) to your phone. After opening the app, walk around your house with your phone and find the place with the strongest Wi-Fi signal. It is likely close to the router. Set up your work station there. </li>\n<li>If your Wi-Fi appears slow during a class or presentation, have other participants shut off their videos </li>\n<li>Always provide participants with PowerPoints or materials after a class or meeting.\nAdditional resources:\n•\tWUIT Telecommuting Resources\n•\tWUIT Call Forwarding Directions\n•\tWUIT Zoom Resources and Tips </li>\n</ol>\n<p>We appreciate your ongoing support and cooperation as we manage this unprecedented situation.

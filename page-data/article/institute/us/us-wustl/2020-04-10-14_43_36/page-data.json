We’ll send this to our community as needed to share new information, including important steps members of the Danforth Campus community must take to help protect the health and well-being of our community. Thank you for your attention to these communications, and for your continued support of our response efforts. </p>\n<p>Updated campus screening instructions\nThe university is no longer using travel history to determine whether individuals are restricted from coming to campus. Our focus has shifted to monitoring symptoms and diagnoses.\nAny Danforth Campus employee, student, contractor or visitor who is currently diagnosed with COVID-19, is experiencing symptoms consistent with COVID-19, or has had direct contact with a person with a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis is not permitted to come onto campus. All others are required to complete self-screening and reporting before coming to campus. Detailed instructions are available on the COVID-19 restrictions and screening for campus access page on the COVID-19 website.\nImportant note: Anyone who is not required to come to campus to perform essential duties does not need to be screened. </p>\n<p>Spring semester update\nAs Danforth Campus students were informed last week, there will be no inperson assignments or in-person final exams for the remainder of the spring 2020 semester. Students should check their email for information about refunds related to residential life housing, dining, parking and a partial refund on the student health fee. For residential students who still have belongings in the residence halls, Residential Life will send an update about plans for packing, shipping or storing of items as soon as the Stay at Home orders are lifted for St.\nLouis City and St. Louis County.\nMore information is available in the Housing section of the Frequently Asked Questions on the COVID-19 website. </p>\n<p>Crisis fund established to help students and employees\nIn response to interest from members of the university community, a new fund has been established to provide support to students and employees who are struggling with financial hardships due to the COVID-19 pandemic. “It’s part of who we are as an institution and as a community to support our most vulnerable through this challenge,” Chancellor Martin said in anews story about the fund. Anyone interested in making a gift may do so via this online form. Students who would like to apply for aid shouldsubmit a request here. The deadline for student applications is tomorrow, April 7 at 5 p.m. Central Time. A process for employees to apply for aid will be available soon. </p>\n<p>Support resources for employees and students\nHuman Resources provides well-being support to help employees cope and thrive through challenges.

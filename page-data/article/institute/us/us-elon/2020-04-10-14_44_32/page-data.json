Today’s email update summarizes the current situation status and highlights some of the successes we are seeing under difficult circumstances.</p>\n<p>Next Monday, April 13, is a university holiday for faculty, staff, and students. (The Law School faculty staff, and students will mark this holiday Friday, April 10.) <strong>Instead of our regular Monday schedule, the next email update to the community will be planned for Tuesday afternoon, April 14, at 2:00 p.m., unless an earlier message is warranted.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Current status – North Carolina</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>There have been <a href=\"https://www.ncdhhs.gov/covid-19-case-count-nc\">2,870 confirmed cases</a> of COVID-19 in the <a href=\"https://www.ncdhhs.gov/divisions/public-health/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-response-north-carolina\">state of North Carolina</a>, including 18 in Alamance County. A total of 33 COVID-19-related deaths have been reported in the state.</li>\n<li>There are no new confirmed or presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in the Elon University community since the two previously reported, both among students who were not on campus at any point during the possible period of contagion.</li>\n<li>The governor’s <a href=\"https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf\">stay-at-home executive order</a> continues to be in effect in North Carolina through the end of the month.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Current status – Elon University</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Elon facilities are closed to walk-in traffic, and most services are operating remotely or by appointment. Faculty and staff members are working remotely, unless they are providing essential services for the campus and the students who were unable to leave due to personal circumstances.</li>\n<li>Essential services available on campus continue to include to-go meals at Lakeside Dining Hall (hours and menu <a href=\"https://www.elondining.com/menu-hours/\">here</a>), Student Health Services (hours and appointment information <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/health-wellness/health-services/\">here</a>), Faculty/Staff Health &#x26; Wellness Clinic (hours and appointment information <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/bft/wellness/\">here</a>), Moseley Center and Mail Services (Monday-Friday, 10 a.m.-2 p.m.), and two computer labs (Alamance 315 and Steers Pavilion) available by card access from 6 a.m.-midnight.</li>\n<li>Consistent with the governor’s <a href=\"https://files.nc.gov/governor/documents/files/EO121-Stay-at-Home-Order-3.pdf\">stay-at-home executive order</a>, students who live on or near campus should not leave their residences except to get food, medicine or necessary supplies; exercise outdoors; to take care of others in need or do volunteer service; or to perform other essential functions outlined in the executive order.</li>\n<li>Spring 2020 Commencement activities have been postponed. University leaders are working with graduates and faculty and hope to announce plans and dates in the coming weeks</li>\n<li>The residence hall move-out process has been extended to May 31. Residence Life will communicate with students and families next week about the move-out process, including options for private companies that will be available to pack and store/ship items. Students who wish to retrieve items or check out of residential facilities before that information has been announced should update their plans in the housing portal, <a href=\"http://www.elon.edu/myhousing\">www.elon.edu/myhousing</a>.</li>\n<li>The university is developing policies and protocols to allow undergraduate students residing on campus to request prorated credits on housing and/or meal plan costs. When those details are finalized, they will be shared with residents of residence halls, university-owned apartments, and Loy chapter houses.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The Elon community engages in the remote environment</strong></p>\n<p>Over the past week, students, faculty and staff have demonstrated resilience and creativity in responding to the challenge of this pandemic. Use of the university’s learning portal, Moodle, is at record levels and hundreds of classes are using video conferencing tools, including Webex, to help students remain engaged and on track to completing the semester.</p>\n<p>Elon faculty are sharing their expertise with our community and subscribers of the local newspaper, the Times-News, with educational articles about COVID-19. Those who have contributed so far are Dave Gammon, Jen Kimbrough, Amanda Chunco, Bilal Ghandour, and Jonathan Su. See their articles on the University Communications website dedicated to <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/university-communications/news-bureau/news-feed/\">Elon in the News</a>.</p>\n<p>We were thrilled to see the success of Elonthon, which <a href=\"https://www.elon.edu/u/news/2020/04/03/virtual-elonthon-this-year-to-provide-very-real-boost-to-duke-childrens-hospital/\">raised more than $173,000 in a virtual dance marathon</a> this past weekend – moved online to occur on the same date it had been scheduled to take place on campus. The students’ leadership and commitment will benefit patients and families at Duke Children’s Hospital.</p>\n<p>Performing Arts at Elon remains strong online. Because “the show must go on,” the spring production of Hamlet was staged using videoconferencing and Facebook Live. Check out the video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/BGc2J27Ozxg\">here</a>.

Theatrical Design and Technology majors and graduates are meeting online weekly for professional development.

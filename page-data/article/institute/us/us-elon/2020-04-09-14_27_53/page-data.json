Key to these recommendations is “social distancing” – avoiding crowds or large gatherings; maintaining at least 6-feet of distance from others; avoiding handshakes or other forms of touching; and regularly washing your hands or using hand sanitizer.</p>\n<p><strong>All members of the Elon community who are on campus   are strongly reminded to be vigilant about these practices. Because of the highly social and relational environment, college campuses can be prime locations for viruses to spread.</strong> Please lead the way as global citizens and carefully follow the advice of public health officials.</p>\n<p><strong>If you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19 (fever, cough and shortness of breath):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not go out and do not come in contact with others.</li>\n<li>If you are a student living on campus or in the Elon area, call (do not visit) Student Health Services at 336-278-7230 during operational hours, or the Cone Health/Alamance Regional Medical Center at 336-538-7050 when Student Health Services is closed.

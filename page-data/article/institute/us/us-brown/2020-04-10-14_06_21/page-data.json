These discussions have made clear that my recent email regarding Brown’s grading policies created many more questions than it resolved. These are difficult moments, and I understand that no single message or policy can address the range of challenges and the scope of uncertainty that members of our community are facing right now.</p>\n<p>In light of the questions and suggestions that many of you raised, I am writing to share two specific updates regarding Brown’s policies on grading and academic standing that were made after careful consultation with faculty, staff, and students as well as the relevant governing academic committees.</p>\n<p>First, in order to provide students with more time and opportunity to consider their grade options this semester, Brown will extend the grade option deadline through the last full week of instruction. All students will now have from Monday, April 13 until Friday, May 1 to decide whether they want to receive letter or S/NC grades for all courses that are not mandatory S/NC. We hope that this extension of the grade option deadline will provide you with the opportunity to make the best possible decisions for your individual circumstances.</p>\n<p>Second, in order to promote academic continuity, the Committee on Academic Standing has established guidelines to assure that no student’s academic standing will be adversely affected by their coursework this Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>For decades, Brown’s academic policies have promoted individualized student learning through principles defined by choice and purpose, and we continue to believe that these are also the most flexible and supportive policies for this moment.</p>\n<p>We are grateful that our community is sustained by the network of trust, support, and partnership that connects us all, whether across campus or around the world. Please continue to reach out to us at [email protected] if we can be of help or support in any way.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Rashid Zia</p>\n<p>Dean of the College</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 03, 2020","title":"To Brown Students: Extending the S/NC Deadline, and Guidelines for Academic Standing","tags":null,"link":"https://covid.brown.edu/news/2020-04-03/extension"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"933816e6-beb2-5f84-9891-1eb86c72d985"}}}

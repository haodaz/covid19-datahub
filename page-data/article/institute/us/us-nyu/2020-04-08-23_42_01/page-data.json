This situation has escalated quickly over the past 24 hours.</p>\n<p>Ensuring that the protection of our community is of paramount importance, and to comply with the Governorâ€™s orders, NYU must now restrict ongoing research being conducted in University buildings and laboratories solely to that which is deemed critical.</p>\n<p>Only critical research as defined below, with the approval of the Department Chair and Dean may continue beyond Monday, March 23.</p>\n<p>Critical research includes:</p>\n<p>Experiments aimed at understanding, treating, or preventing COVID-19 viral infection</p>\n<p>Work involving irreplaceable biological specimens, including plants, samples, and cell lines, that would otherwise be lost</p>\n<p>Maintenance of essential equipment that cannot be attended to remotely or powered down without significant cost or consequence to the research effort</p>\n<p>Preservation of unique or rare materials and/or reagents that require routine care</p>\n<p>Completion of long-term experiments which, if ceased, would result in extraordinary consequences</p>\n<p>Research that involves care for animals including continual treatment, manipulation, special feeding or other accommodations that can be carried out with minimal social contact with others and appropriate precautions</p>\n<p>Like you, I am concerned about the long-term impact this will have. Although heartbreaking, now is the time to protect ourselves and keep others safe.</p>\n<p>Stacie Grossman Bloom</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Research</p>\n<p>New York University</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Suspension of Non-Essential Research","tags":null,"link":"https://www.nyu.edu/life/safety-health-wellness/coronavirus-information/messages-to-the-community/suspension-of-non-essential-research.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6ab64410-6074-5f83-8a21-8badb83fdc44"}}}

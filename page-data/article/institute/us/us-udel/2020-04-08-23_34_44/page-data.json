The University remains committed to your health and safety, so we are reaching out to our graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to share important information regarding academic policies and ways to protect your health and wellbeing during this time.</p>\n<p>The information below gives you an overview of what to expect and where you can find additional resources. University faculty and research advisers are available to help, as they will also be important sources of information and guidance for you. We are all seeking to maintain continuity in our courses and research, even while University buildings are only open to essential personnel and not accessible for routine activities.</p>\n<p>In addition to reading the information below, please check your email regularly for continued updates. Also visit www.udel.edu/coronavirus to find more information on the University’s response initiatives as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic situation. The site is continually updated as new information becomes available.</p>\n<p>Thank you,</p>\n<p>Doug Doren</p>\n<p>Interim Vice Provost for Graduate &#x26; Professional Education and Dean of the Graduate College</p>\n<p>Resources for Graduate Students</p>\n<p>Academics</p>\n<p>Academic Policies</p>\n<p>We are actively working on addressing flexibility for graduate study academic policies. Additional information will be forthcoming.</p>\n<p>Courses</p>\n<p>Graduate students enrolled in coursework should follow the guidance being given to all UD students, and expect that classes will be delivered online starting March 30. Your instructors will provide further guidance about specific plans for their courses.</p>\n<p>Research</p>\n<p>All on-campus research has been restricted to essential activities. Building access will be provided only for the most critical needs (e.g., maintaining animals, critical cell cultures, unique reagents, essential equipment and materials). Graduate student researchers should work with their advisers or PI to plan efforts that will allow them to engage in research remotely. Find additional guidance and protocols—including access to Virtual Town Halls recorded on March 16 and 24—on this webpage.</p>\n<p>Teaching</p>\n<p>Students employed as teaching assistants should work with faculty in charge of their courses to plan how they will support online teaching. Both the Faculty Commons and the Center for Teaching and Assessment of Learning (CTAL) have excellent resources to support effective distance learning on their course continuity websites. CTAL will partner with Faculty Commons colleagues to offer bi-weekly conversations designed to help instructors and graduate assistants succeed in a digital learning environment. Specific details are forthcoming and will be published on the CTAL website. While specific assignments may change with the shift to online classes, expectations for TA workloads are the same, being limited to 20 hours per week, on average.</p>\n<p>Theses and Dissertations</p>\n<p>Please plan to have committee meetings and dissertation defenses remotely. You do not need to be on campus to submit a thesis or dissertation. Electronic signatures will be accepted on the signature pages and defense forms. The signed signature pages will be accepted as attachments, and the Graduate College will print to bond paper. There is some flexibility in deadlines for submission in time for Spring 2020 graduation. Please contact Mary Martin for additional details.</p>\n<p>Finances</p>\n<p>Graduate stipends</p>\n<p>The President and Provost have asked that faculty continue to support graduate students in their current roles, even if they are unable to continue their work in person, with compensation at current levels. Due to the range of different work they do, research assistants (RAs), teaching assistants (TAs) and graduate assistants (GAs) may each be affected differently. Individuals should ask their supervisor about how to continue carrying out their work responsibilities. In many cases, their work assignments will change so that they can be productive without coming to campus. For example, TAs may be asked to support online courses, and most graduate student researchers will have to do work that does not require access to a laboratory.</p>\n<p>Financial Hardship</p>\n<p>Although the University is committed to continuity of pay for graduate students on contract, we recognize that other factors related to COVID-19 may have an impact on finances. Emergency loans (up to $1,000) are available from the Graduate College for students on contract. Please contact Mary Martin to apply. The Student Financial Services Office also has an emergency loan program (up to $500). The contact for these loans is Joseph Bradley.</p>\n<p>The University of Delaware’s Student Crisis Fund also supports eligible students who face a serious financial hardship due to an unanticipated crisis. Situations are considered on a case-by-case basis, and the fund may be able to help with such issues as food or home insecurity, out-of-pocket medical costs or other emergencies.

The University is also discouraging personal travel to reduce risks for exposure in other locations that may present higher risk. Please review the Travel FAQ for the latest information on other restrictions. Members of our community are reminded to register all travel plans with the University’s Office of Risk Management on this form. Graduate students who received funding through a Graduate College Travel Award for meetings that have been canceled, or who need to change plans, should contact Carol Steinbrecher. It is our intention that students not have to bear the cost of any changes.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"University of Delaware Graduate College","tags":null,"link":"https://grad.udel.edu/about/covid-19-update-for-grad-students/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5de0c92b-2695-5268-9cd7-435d1c87e606"}}}

Delinquent Holds for outstanding charges from a previous quarter will remain in place. Course material fees will be adjusted for courses that, in this new learning environment, do not require the equipment or other educational resources traditionally covered by the fee. Of the approximately 280 course material fees typically assessed, 8 courses will retain these fees because the educational resources will still be provided to support the student-learning experience. Please allow the first week of instruction for these adjustments to be made to your student account. The Registrar’s website will be updated to reflect which course material fees remain in effect for spring. All changes are in effect for spring 2020 only.</p>\n<p>For guidance on tuition and fees beyond those listed above, please reference the communication released March 25, 2020, to all students.</p>\n<p>If you find you are in a position that you cannot continue attendance for spring 2020, please ensure to follow standard graduate and undergraduate cancellation and withdrawal procedures, which can be found on the respective websites:</p>\n<p>Graduate students , please reference the Graduate Division’s website.</p>\n<p>, please reference the Graduate Division’s website.

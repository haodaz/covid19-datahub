Your UCR Library staff have been working diligently to provide support, services, and remote access to resources, which are outlined in this new LibGuide on Expanded / Free Access during the COVID-19 closure.</p>\n<p>Additionally, UCR affiliates can access electronic copies of most library materials from off-campus locations through the HathiTrust Emergency Temporary Access Service.</p>\n<p>The Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS) permits special access for HathiTrust member libraries located in the U.S. that suffer an unexpected or involuntary, temporary disruption to normal operations, such as closure for a public health emergency, requiring the library to be closed to its patrons, or otherwise restrict print collection access services.</p>\n<p>The service makes it possible for member library patrons to obtain lawful access to specific digital materials in HathiTrust that correspond to physical books held by their own library. The Emergency Temporary Access Service will enable many HathiTrust member libraries to continue supporting the teaching, learning, and research mission of their institutions during said disruption in service.</p>\n<p>Through the HathisTrust ETAS, UCR faculty, staff, and students now have:</p>\n<p>Continued access to the scholarly record of print collections held by their home institution with a digitized copy in HathiTrust.</p>\n<p>Reading access to the book online, within a web browser. There is no option to download the work in full.</p>\n<p>Ability to “check out” a copy for a limited period of time with an auto-renew feature for books still in use. Access to items is 1-1; 1 copy on the member library shelf, 1 individual access to the digital copy; 2 copies, 2 concurrent users of the digital item.</p>\n<p>How to Access UCR Print Materials via HathiTrust</p>\n<p>LOG IN” button. To use the HathiTrust ETAS, go to <a href=\"http://hathitrust.org\">http://hathitrust.org</a> and select the yellow “” button. Find and select University of California, Riverside from the list of partner institutions. Select “Continue”. You will arrive at UCR’s Central Authentication Service. Enter your UCR NetID and Password. When you have successfully logged in, you will be returned to the HathiTrust website.</p>\n<p>Review the HathiTrust FAQ and Use Guide before you get started.</p>\n<p>Remember, your library staff are still available to answer questions and provide support, even in this remote-working situation. You can always Ask a Librarian if you need additional guidance.</p>\n<p>Be safe and stay healthy,</p>\n<p>Steven Mandeville-Gamble</p>\n<p>University Librarian</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 06, 2020","title":"Expanded digital access to UCR Library content during the COVID-19 crisis","tags":null,"link":"https://insideucr.ucr.edu/announcements/2020/04/06/expanded-digital-access-ucr-library-content-during-covid-19-crisis"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4bba512e-41cb-5a1f-9c50-ead7f25cdf17"}}}

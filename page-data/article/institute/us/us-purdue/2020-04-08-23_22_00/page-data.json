Eric Holcomb’s executive order asking residents to stay at home except as necessary to perform essential functions and operations, which includes those of the university. These new directives take effect at 11:59 p.m. tomorrow (Tuesday, March 24) and currently last through 11:59 p.m. April 6.</p>\n<p>Please be assured that your remote instruction will continue and your instructors and those who support remote learning continue to be hard at work to make sure you can complete your programs this semester. Hicks Undergraduate Library will continue to be available for those who need wi-fi access and computer access.</p>\n<p>In addition, residence halls will remain open to those of you who were not able to return home. All employees who work to support you in the halls and with food service will continue to come to campus. Students will be able to leave their halls to be outdoors and to pick up food.</p>\n<p>Those who have plans to move out of residence halls over the next two weeks may do so, as that is covered under the order’s exception for essential travel.</p>\n<p>We kindly ask all students to continue to be mindful of the need to practice safe social distancing and not gather in groups of 10 or more.</p>\n<p>We thank you, again, for the care you are showing each other during this unprecedented time.</p>\n<p>Continue to watch the Purdue COVID-19 Website for updates and frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Beth McCuskey</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Student Life</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 23, 2020","title":"Additional guidance for students from Beth McCuskey, Vice Provost for Student Life","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.purdue.edu/updates/additional-guidance-for-students-from-dean-of-students-dr-katie/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"84efe994-7b81-5dd4-a038-bafa60a49756"}}}

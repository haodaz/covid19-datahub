Thank you for your patience and understanding as we adapt to this extraordinary and ever-changing situation.</p>\n<p>Guided by current public health and safety recommendations, our plan for summer 2020 is as follows:</p>\n<p>Courses</p>\n<p>Virtually all courses, graduate and undergraduate, that start in the months of May or June will be conducted remotely. Limited exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis for small scale experiential learning following a public health review and approval. Details on how departments can request exceptions will be shared with department heads soon.</p>\n<p>The decision on whether or not courses that start in July will be conducted face-to-face will be made no later than May 15. This includes Early Start, Summer Start and Summer College for High School programs.</p>\n<p>It is our hope that we are able to offer all courses originally planned for summer in a remote format. Academic progress for all students continues to be a priority.</p>\n<p>Instructors that need assistance with transitioning courses to remote learning should contact innovativelearningteam@purdue.edu.</p>\n<p>Students that need assistance with learning remotely can find resources here. The academic assistance programs that students depend on while on campus will continue to be available remotely.</p>\n<p>Conferences and Events</p>\n<p>All May conferences and events on campus are canceled.</p>\n<p>The decision on whether or not June conferences and events will be held will be made by April 15.</p>\n<p>The decision on whether or not July conference and events will be held will be made by May 15.</p>\n<p>Athletics will continue to follow campus, NCAA and Big Ten guidance.</p>\n<p>Summer Transition, Advising and Registration (STAR)</p>\n<p>STAR will be delivered remotely beginning May 11. Orientation Programs is creating live and recorded experiences to supplement Virtual STAR (VSTAR), a program that for many years has successfully introduced international students to Purdue University. These offerings will engage students with faculty, staff and current students and provide an introduction to campus culture, resources and advising throughout the summer.</p>\n<p>Incoming students who have accepted their offers of admission will be enrolled in VSTAR automatically. Students will work with an academic advisor virtually to pre-register for their courses. Details about that process will be included in VSTAR.</p>\n<p>On-Campus Visits and Events for Incoming Students</p>\n<p>If we find ourselves able to resume public events/gatherings in July (again, a decision will be made by May 15), we will resume Admissions and Orientation events at that time as well.</p>\n<p>Our Admissions team is actively preparing plans for what those events will look like, with the goal, as always, to give students and their families a chance to get to know Purdue and everything that makes being a Boilermaker so great. Details on what these events may look like will be shared in the coming weeks as health and safety guidelines continue to evolve.</p>\n<p>Like many of the decisions weâ€™ve had to make over the past several weeks, I know that this information will come as a relief to some and a disappointment to others. In any case, I hope that it helps you plan and anticipate what the summer months will look like on our campus.</p>\n<p>As always, the Purdue COVID-19 site continue to be your best source for the most up-to-date information and answers to the most frequently asked questions.</p>\n<p>Thank you, once again, for everything that each of you is doing to adapt to this unprecedented situation. Our campus continues to thrive because of your hard work and flexibility. You are truly what makes Purdue so great.</p>\n<p>Best regards,</p>\n<p>Jay T. Akridge</p>\n<p>Provost and Executive Vice President for Academic Affairs and Diversity</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 06, 2020","title":"An update on summer from Provost Jay Akridge","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.purdue.edu/updates/an-update-on-summer-from-provost-jay-akridge/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2bc43cfe-e532-5163-8b1d-47d63b418aee"}}}

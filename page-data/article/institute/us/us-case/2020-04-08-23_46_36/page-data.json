It is on the agenda for Monday’s full Faculty Senate meeting, and we will update you afterward.</p>\n<p>Technology Access: We know some of our students live in areas with limited or even no connectivity to the Internet. Earlier this week, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) reached agreement with providers to increase efforts to connect people who need access. UTech has provided details of the additional services on its website, under the headline “How to Get Connected and Stay Connected.\"</p>\n<p>Housing</p>\n<p>Departure Deadline: Students not approved to remain in campus housing must be out of their rooms as of noon, Sunday, March 22. Their keycard access to their building will be turned off at that time.</p>\n<p>This deadline does not require students to take all of their belongings (i.e. fully check out), although students are strongly encouraged to do so. The university will provide additional guidance soon for those who need to return to pack all of the items in their campus residences.</p>\n<p>Make Sure We Know You Have Checked Out: For those who already have packed all of their things and departed—or will be doing so prior to noon on March 22—please make sure that you have completed checkout per the guidance provided in an email earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Make Sure We Know You Are Not Here—But Will Be Coming Back to Pack Your Belongings: Please visit My Housing now and select the “Notify housing of deferred checkout” option in the website navigation. The university will provide additional information about subsequent move-out procedures as soon as they are available.</p>\n<p>Health &#x26; Wellness</p>\n<p>Feeling Sick: Stay at home and stay away from others with whom you live. If you are on or near campus, call student health at 216.368.2450. If you are home, call your local health provider.</p>\n<p>Feeling Anxious: If on campus or within Ohio, contact counseling services at 216.368.5872. If home, contact your local provider. If you do not have a nearby provider, contact counseling at 216.368.5872 for assistance.</p>\n<p>Feeling OK: Good. Try to stay that way by:</p>\n<p>taking frequent breaks from constant COVID-19-focused news and social media;</p>\n<p>remembering that social distancing does not mean social isolation . Stay in touch with your friends and others; find ways to offer support; and</p>\n<p>. Stay in touch with your friends and others; find ways to offer support; and getting adequate sleep, healthy meals and regular exercise.</p>\n<p>With best wishes,Jeffrey Wolcowitz, Dean of Undergraduate StudiesLou Stark, Vice President for Student AffairsSara Lee, Executive Director of University Health and Counseling Services</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"March 19 Message to Undergraduates: Academics, Housing and Well-Being","tags":null,"link":"https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/health-serviceshealth-updates/march-19-message-undergraduates-academics-housing-and-well-being"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ddec7ade-7883-574f-9144-150406576d9d"}}}

This option applies only to this semester. As in the usual application of this option, professors are not told which students are taking their courses Pass/No Pass.</p>\n<p>Deadline to Drop or Add Second-Half Courses is TODAY: As you may recall from last week’s communication, the university extended this deadline by one week to today (Friday, March 27).</p>\n<p>Academic Advisor Check-Ins: We encourage undergraduates to review their plans with their academic advisors, and contact their navigators regarding other matters.</p>\n<p>No Make-Up Days for March 16-17: Because the cancellation of classes Monday and Tuesday (March 16-17) was part of the university’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak, they are being treated as the equivalent of cancellations required by inclement weather. The last day of classes remains Monday, April 27.</p>\n<p>Reading Days Remain: The reading days scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday (April 28-29) also are unchanged.</p>\n<p>May Term Courses Go Remote: In light of uncertainty regarding when the COVID-19 public health crisis will ease, the university has chosen to have May Term courses delivered remotely.</p>\n<p>Summer Term Registration Dates Delayed: Given that summer courses have start dates ranging from June 1 to July 6, the university continues to assess options regarding the delivery of these courses. As that consideration continues, the university has delayed the opening of summer registration. Please consult SIS for the date on which you can begin registering for respective summer courses.</p>\n<p>We wish you the best as you adapt to these unexpected circumstances for your spring semester.</p>\n<p>Ben Vinson III</p>\n<p>Provost and Executive Vice President</p>\n<p>Donald Feke</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Undergraduate Education &#x26; Academic &#x26; Faculty Affairs</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"March 27 Message to Undergraduates: Undergraduate Academic Updates for this Semester","tags":null,"link":"https://case.edu/studentlife/healthcounseling/health-serviceshealth-updates/march-27-message-undergraduates-undergraduate-academic-updates-semester"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"792dc322-1deb-59e4-8c70-644cf6c7fb2c"}}}

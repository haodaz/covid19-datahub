Pritzker announced he will sign an order extending the state’s “stay-at-home” order through April 30. In response, Northwestern also is extending through April 30 its guidance that only individuals who are essential to the University’s ongoing operations can remain physically on site. All other provisions of the previously announced “stay-at-home” directive remain in place.</p>\n<p>In addition, due to the governor’s new order, remote classes will be extended until at least May 4. A decision will be made by April 17 about whether we will continue remote classes beyond May 4.</p>\n<p>Please take care,</p>\n<p>Jonathan Holloway</p>\n<p>Provost and Professor</p>\n<p>Kathleen Hagerty</p>\n<p>Interim Provost Designate</p>\n<p>Craig Johnson</p>\n<p>Senior Vice President for Business and Finance</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Stay-At-Home Order Extended: Coronavirus/COVID-19 Updates","tags":null,"link":"https://www.northwestern.edu/coronavirus-covid-19-updates/developments/updates/march-31-stay-at-home-order-extended.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2697470d-9ab7-554a-8183-d31c9140fc94"}}}

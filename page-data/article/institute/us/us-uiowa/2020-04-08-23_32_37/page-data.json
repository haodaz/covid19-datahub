The university’s faculty will continue to deliver excellent instruction virtually, which allows students to receive course credit and stay on their educational path toward degree completion and graduation. For this reason, the university will not be refunding students’ tuition for the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>The university understands this is not what students or their instructors signed up for at the start of the semester. The decision to move to virtual instruction was not made easily, but it was determined that proactive steps were necessary to maintain the health and safety of our students, faculty, and staff. The UI is not alone in this decision, as hundreds of universities nationwide have made the same choice in light of the global pandemic. The UI is recognized as a national leader in online instruction and already is one of the largest providers of online education, ranking in the top 50 nationally. Teaching and learning experts from across campus collaborated with faculty to transition courses to a virtual environment. So, while the format for delivering instruction may have changed temporarily, the UI remains committed to continuing to provide a world-class educational experience for its students during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>The university will refund, on a prorated basis, several fees including:</p>\n<p>Room and Board : Refund prorated March 19 to May 16</p>\n<p>: Refund prorated March 19 to May 16 Recreation Fee : Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16</p>\n<p>: Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16 Arts &#x26; Cultural Events Fee : Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16</p>\n<p>: Refund prorated from March 23 to May 16 Course Fees: Colleges are currently reviewing course specific fees. Refunds will be determined on a course-by-course basis.</p>\n<p>University Billing fees</p>\n<p>The UI will not charge late payment fees for U-Bills for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester. Typically, students who pay less than the minimum amount due on their U-Bill are assessed a late payment fee. This fee will be waived for the remainder of the Spring 2020 semester.</p>\n<p>Registration restrictions, or registration holds, for past due balances will not be assessed for Summer 2020 or Fall 2020 registrations. This applies to any past due balances on U-Bills commencing on Jan. 1, 2020, or later.

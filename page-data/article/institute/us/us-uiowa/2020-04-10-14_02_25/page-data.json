A decision regarding in-person programs beginning after June 13, 2020, will be made later this semester. Summer programs include but are not limited to youth programs, sports camps, wildlife camps, research programs, conferences/workshops, and other programming for adults. Summer programs that do not involve minors may develop virtual programming without review by the Office of the Provost. However, those conducting summer programs for minors must contact the Office of the Provost as soon as possible if they are considering developing alternatives to in-person offerings (provost-office@uiowa.edu). These programs will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>Orientation/Registration Programs for New, Domestic First-Year, and Transfer Students to Go Online</p>\n<p>Due to COVID-19 safety precautions, the University of Iowa has made the difficult decision to transition to online orientation and registration programs and services through the end of July 2020. This information was communicated to incoming students and their families earlier this week.</p>\n<p>Additional opportunities for new students and their families to connect virtually with other students and with faculty and staff will be offered throughout the summer. A full schedule of events will be available in May on the orientation website. The UI looks forward to welcoming its incoming class of Hawkeyes during the OnIowa! program which will take place Aug. 18–23, 2020.</p>\n<p>Cambus Service Update</p>\n<p>SERVICE ADJUSTMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 6</p>\n<p>Cambus will continue to provide interim service but with some adjustments after analysis of campus needs and ridership data, including switching to a weeknight demand-response service from 9 p.m. midnight. Visit the Cambus alerts webpage for complete details.</p>\n<p>Helpful Reminders</p>\n<p>WORKING REMOTELY</p>\n<p>Unless you perform a critical function that must be completed on campus, UI employees outside of UI Health Care have been directed to work remotely in accordance with the state public disaster emergency, which the governor has extended until April 30, 2020. Each of you contributes to the successful operation of the university, but working from home supports social distancing and reduces the threat of COVID-19 for everyone, including colleagues who must perform essential services on campus.</p>\n<p>SELF-REPORTING COVID-19</p>\n<p>If you are still reporting to work on campus and are experiencing symptoms consistent with or are diagnosed with COVID-19, please stay home and report your illness to your supervisor and/or local HR leader. Your supervisor or senior HR leader will follow the COVID-19 self-reporting protocol to request a cleaning and ensure appropriate notification to fellow employees.</p>\n<p>ALL NON-ESSENTIAL BUSINESS TRAVEL CANCELED</p>\n<p>Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds canceled all non-essential business travel for state agencies, which includes Iowa’s public universities. Accordingly, all university-related non-essential domestic travel is prohibited until further notice, effective immediately. This includes travel to conferences, for training or meetings, or athletic travel. Essential travel is defined as travel that is essential to the operation of the university, that no alternative method of convening is possible, and that the health and safety of state of Iowa employees will be appropriately managed.</p>\n<p>Essential travel must:</p>\n<p>Support the health care clinical enterprise</p>\n<p>Preserve the safety of a research subject</p>\n<p>Preserve the results of a research activity</p>\n<p>Earn academic credit that is necessary to meet a graduation requirement</p>\n<p>Maintain critical business continuity for the university</p>\n<p>Domestic and international trips currently routing for approval or already approved in ProTrav will be marked “Canceled per Iowa Governor directive,” and both the traveler and approver will be notified of this change. If a trip was previously approved and is deemed essential per the guidelines above, you will need to resubmit your request through ProTrav. You can find more information about the approval process and how to submit a request on the travel page.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Campus update: Summer programming, CAMBUS, and other helpful reminders","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.uiowa.edu/news/2020/04/campus-update-summer-programming-cambus-and-other-helpful-reminders"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f2006705-56d5-571b-903c-217b6be9523b"}}}

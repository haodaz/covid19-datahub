These celebrations will include messages from university leadership, Board of Regents leadership, and other speakers, along with recognition of individual graduates.</p>\n<p>The UI will also send a package to each of its graduating students that, among other items, will include a commemorative commencement program that recognizes their achievement during this unique and challenging historic moment.</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 graduates who participate in the virtual ceremony may still take part in an in-person ceremony in fall 2020 or spring 2021, and graduates who would like to purchase their cap and gown can do so through the Hawk Shop website.</p>\n<p>By the end of the semester, spring 2020 graduates will have faced not only the usual trials and tribulations of attaining a university degree, but also will have overcome the unprecedented situation of rapidly transitioning to online learning in the midst of a global pandemic—no mean feat. We are so very proud of all of you, and grateful for how quickly you’ve adapted.</p>\n<p>Thank you for the great fortitude you’ve demonstrated during this crisis.</p>\n<p>See you at the ceremonies!</p>\n<p>Bruce Harreld,</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Montserrat Fuentes,</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President and Provost</p>\n<p>For more information, please visit commencement.uiowa.edu.</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 Grading Options for Undergraduates</p>\n<p>Considering Pass/Nonpass Grading? Things to Think About</p>\n<p>Advisors from across campus have pulled together information for students to consider when deciding whether to choose Pass/Nonpass grading. Please find the basics below or more detailed information here. Students are encouraged to check their college’s website for grading information specific to the college.</p>\n<p>A grade of C- or greater will translate to a P grade.</p>\n<p>Any grade lower than a C- will translate to N, and no credit will be awarded.</p>\n<p>Neither the P nor the N will affect a student’s GPA.</p>\n<p>Students interested in the P/N option will be able to opt in through MyUI. That page will be available no later than April 20. Students have until May 8 to make their choice for each of their courses.</p>\n<p>Students may find it helpful to wait until they have completed more graded work and exams before making a decision.</p>\n<p>Students should talk with their academic advisor to discuss their options and situation.</p>\n<p>UI Libraries</p>\n<p>Emergency temporary access to copyrighted books</p>\n<p>Effective immediately, and until normal access to physical collections resumes, UI students, faculty, and staff have online access to a large portion of the University Libraries’ print collection—volumes that would have been difficult to access from library facilities that are closed due to COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Reading access to digitized copies of print volumes has been granted to the UI by HathiTrust, a not-for-profit, collaborative digital library that holds more than 17 million volumes digitized from academic and research libraries. The UI Libraries, in collaboration with the Big Ten Academic Alliance, is a founding member of HathiTrust.</p>\n<p>This means that any books available through HathiTrust that are also in the UI Libraries’ collections will be available online without the additional step of requesting a digital scan. HathiTrust’s online collection contains nearly half of the UI Libraries’ book collection, and HathiTrust has provided detailed instructions, including how to use the service on a phone or tablet.</p>\n<p>For help with access to these and other digital resources, please contact UI Libraries.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Campus update: Spring 2020 virtual commencement celebration and more","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.uiowa.edu/news/2020/04/campus-update-spring-2020-virtual-commencement-celebration-and-more"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"19752923-3028-503b-b06f-accc8771c2dd"}}}

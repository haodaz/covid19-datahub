This decision to cancel Commencement comes after careful consideration by students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>Commencement is one of my favorite events, and I recognize the disappointment this will cause our seniors who were looking forward to the culmination of their academic career at Binghamton. I know that Commencement is a special time for the campus and especially for our seniors, and this decision is difficult for all of us.</p>\n<p>It is my greatest hope that we will be able to hold our ceremonies at a later date. Students who are eligible to graduate will be surveyed in the near future and are encouraged to respond to help the University select a date or dates in the summer and/or fall when the campus, family and friends will be able to join in our traditional ceremonies. In the meantime, I hope that everyone will understand our reasons for postponing this yearâ€™s Commencement and will take time to reach out to congratulate and recognize our graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>This is an extraordinary time for the campus and for all of our students. The members of the Class of 2020 will always have a special place among Binghamton University alumni. I look forward to seeing you soon for an event that you will always remember.</p>\n<p>(Watch a video message from President Stenger.)</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Harvey G.

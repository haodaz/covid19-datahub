Each year, the summer camp welcomes kids ages 8 to 12 and their grandparents to campus for a unique learning experience — with activities that highlight MSU academics and create lasting memories.</p>\n<p>“While this was a tough and disappointing decision to make, we are confident that it was the right one,” said Aimee Klevorn, communications manager of Michigan State University’s Alumni Office. “Our office is dedicated to keeping Spartans safe by following the CDC’s recommendations for minimizing the impact and spread of the virus. We also wanted to make the decision in a timely manner as many of our participants travel from out of state or even internationally to attend.”</p>\n<p>The Alumni Office is preparing for next year’s program, set to occur June 29-July 1, 2021. “We hope to encourage grandparents and grandchildren to engage with each other virtually for now,” Klevorn said.</p>\n<p>Registered participants will receive a full refund and preferred registration for next year’s program, and those who received a scholarship for the 2020 program will receive the same scholarship amount for the 2021 program.</p>\n<p>Children who would have been 12 years of age for the 2020 program will receive an additional year of eligibility to participate in next year’s program.</p>\n<p>“We are extremely grateful to our participants, volunteers and instructors who have provided encouragement and handled the news with patience and grace,” Klevorn said.</p>\n<p>For more information about Grandparents University, email the MSU Alumni Office at gpu@msu.edu.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Grandparents University 2020 is canceled","tags":null,"link":"https://msutoday.msu.edu/news/2020/grandparents-university-2020-is-canceled/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a2f32546-9f39-521e-8e16-299021017785"}}}

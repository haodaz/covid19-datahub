This includes a safe, protected, inclusive, on-line learning environment for our faculty and students.  As such, there are safeguards in Zoom that we instituted to  <strong>proactively address</strong>  the class breaches experienced this week as well as Zoom features that can be leveraged to manage participants  <strong>during class</strong>.  These are as follows:​</p>\n<p><strong>On-Line Waiting Room​</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>We enabled the Waiting Room feature for all classes and meetings conducted via Zoom.​</li>\n<li>Any participant who does not login using their USC Zoom credentials automatically will be placed in the Waiting Room and will be presented with the following <a href=\"https://keepteaching.usc.edu/waiting-room-message-2/\">message</a>.​</li>\n<li>This will allow the Meeting Host to determine who to admit in class from the <a href=\"https://keepteaching.usc.edu/waiting-room-add-or-remove-participants/\">Waiting Room</a>.​</li>\n<li>Note: The Meeting Host will need to monitor the Waiting Room throughout the meeting to admit those that did not authenticate with their USC Zoom credentials.​</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Class Management</strong>  ​</p>\n<p>In the event that you encounter a disruptive participant during class, we recommend that you:​</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://keepteaching.usc.edu/remove-participants-from-class/\">Remove</a> participant from the class.​</li>\n<li>Use the <a href=\"https://keepteaching.usc.edu/lock-a-meeting/\">Lock</a> feature to keep participant out of the class altogether.​</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While these are strong preventative measures, additional development is underway to further tighten up the access to our on-line learning environment and classes.  Please let us know how ITS can make this transition smoother and to support you as you continue your teaching on-line. ​​</p>\n<p>Best regards,​ ​<br>\n<em>Douglas Shook</em><br>\n=======================================<br>\nDouglas Shook, Ph.D.<br>\nChief Information Officer</p>\n<p>e-mail: <a href=\"mailto:shook@usc.edu\">shook@usc.edu</a><br>\nZoom: <a href=\"https://usc.zoom.us/j/3832246577\">https://usc.zoom.us/j/3832246577</a></p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 25, 2020","title":"Message to Faculty Regarding Zoom Security Changes","tags":null,"link":"https://sites.usc.edu/coronavirus/message-to-faculty-regarding-zoom-security-changes/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"f9defa8c-e58e-5f9c-b8fd-02e510b7c12c"}}}

Apparently, the rain kept away the news. Hopefully, you all got to jump in a few puddles today or cuddle up on the couch under a blanket. As for me, my home office is a closet (literally) with no windows, and so for a brief moment I thought we had a rat infestation on the roof, but no it was just raindrops.</p>\n<p>A few things to draw your attention to as we continue to respond to this new normal. Please attend to issues of accessibility in your research, teaching, and correspondence.</p>\n<p>Accessibility During COVID-19</p>\n<p>In Accessibility Suffers During Pandemic, Inside Higher Ed describes how students with disabilities and their advocates worry about access to equitable education. Our Disability Services Center has been working around the clock to ensure our students have appropriate access. Please reach out to them if you need help, can volunteer to help others, or have questions.</p>\n<p>Microsoft also published an interesting article, What the disability community can teach us about working remotely, in which they describe working with and learning from their employees and by continuing to prioritize accessibility in these shifting circumstances. Microsoft has been a leader in inclusive hiring and work practices. It is nice to see them continuing to do so.</p>\n<p>Division of Career Pathways Services Update</p>\n<p>Please note that DCP will continue to offer one-on-one career counseling appointments through both Zoom andphone as well as “virtual office hours” on Wednesdays from 1-3 to temporarily replace in-person drop in times.

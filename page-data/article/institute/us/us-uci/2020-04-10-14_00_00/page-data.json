Fortunately,HathiTrust holds digital copies of many of these works. They have created an Emergency Temporary Access Service (ETAS), which opens up copyrighted material in the HathiTrust Digital Library to member institutions with copies of those items in their physical collections.</p>\n<p>Millions of digitized books available through HathiTrust which are also in UC librariesâ€™ collections are now available online to UC students, faculty, and staff. Use your UC credentials to login to theHathiTrust Digital Library, and then check-out in copyright books for online reading access for renewable one-hour loans. You can also still, as before, read and download public domain books at will.</p>\n<p>Click here for more information. Questions or comments?

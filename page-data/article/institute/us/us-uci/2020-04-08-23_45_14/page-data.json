Here are a few reminders and updates regarding the COVID-19 virus and the adjustments Graduate Division is making.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to our 2020 Grad Slam Champion: Rebecca Riley!</p>\n<p>I want to start this message with a very heartfelt congratulations to Rebecca Riley, who was named UCI’s 2020 Grad Slam Champion last month! Rebecca is a doctoral student studying Theoretical Particle Physics. In her Grad Slam talk entitled In the Dark Corners of the Universe, Rebecca describes the mystery of dark matter and its importance to the world - all in under 3 minutes! Take a listen to her impressive talk on why dark matter...well, matters!

We know Rebecca would have made us proud!</p>\n<p>DSC COVID-19 Update</p>\n<p>The DSC website has been updated with accessibility tips and resources for online instruction and remote classes for faculty and students.

Talking to students is honestly the highlight of my day!</p>\n<p>All you need to do is click this link and you’ll be in: <a href=\"https://uci.zoom.us/j/7277477057\">https://uci.zoom.us/j/7277477057</a>. Below are our office hours for the next two weeks. All times are Pacific Standard Time.</p>\n<p>Thursday, March 26: 1pm – 1:30pm</p>\n<p>Monday, March 30: 9:00am – 9:30am</p>\n<p>Tuesday, March 31: 1pm – 1:30pm</p>\n<p>Wednesday, April 1: 10am – 10:30am</p>\n<p>Thursday, April 2: 12:30pm – 1:00pm</p>\n<p>Friday, April 3: 10am – 10:30am</p>\n<p>In Closing</p>\n<p>I want to close today by talking a bit about how many of us are feeling right now. I heard the news today that Cal State was on a hiring freeze only shortly before learning that the partner of someone I care about a lot got a tenure track position at a community college. I heard the news today that Brown University was on a hiring freeze only shortly after seeing a copy of a contract for a tenure track position that someone asked me to look over so she could sign it. The roller coaster of emotions is nearly crushing, and these are not my own jobs but those of people in the UCI community. I can only imagine how it must feel to be at or near the end of your academic journey as either a post-doc or grad student and looking into this job market.</p>\n<p>Even for those who have a few years for the economy to recover before you search for jobs, summer internships have been disrupted, partners and family members may have been laid off. This is a brutal time for so many. Some of you may feel emboldened or focused or motivated by these times of crisis. Some of you may be able to only do the bare minimum each day to keep your health, your family’s health, and your life in order. I hope you are kind and generous with yourselves. We are not even two weeks into the “stay at home” order, and we have no idea what time will bring.</p>\n<p>It is okay to grieve. And please know that you are grieving. I’ve said before that I am an optimist, and I remain so. We are all living through something that no living person has ever seen, and we must hope that we will never see it again.</p>\n<p>“When the unthinkable happens, the lighthouse is hope. Once we choose hope, everything is possible.” – Christopher Reeve</p>\n<p>I am deeply sad for the pain that so many of you are feeling. I am anxious on my own. But I also have hope. I hope that we will learn from this time. I hope that we will find a cure. I hope that we will see a vaccine soon. I hope that disruption will be minimal.</p>\n<p>And as always, I hope to see you all in person soon!</p>\n<p>Gillian Hayes</p>\n<p>Kleist Professor of Informatics</p>\n<p>Vice Provost for Graduate Education</p>\n<p>Dean of the Graduate Division</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 20, 2025","title":"Graduate Division COVID-19 Update","tags":null,"link":"https://uci.edu/coronavirus/messages/200325-grad-division.php"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"939354bb-de42-56a7-9bae-7aba4659efd8"}}}

Instructors should ensure that one or more colleagues have administrator-level access to their Stellar websites.</p>\n<p>In the event that later in the semester a subject cannot continue (e.g., the instructor becomes ill and backup is not possible), a department or program head may make a request to the Chair of the Faculty that full credit for the subject be awarded, with PE/NE grades submitted based on work completed to that point.</p>\n<p>Please do not hesitate to contact me with any comments or questions.</p>\n<p>Rick</p>\n<p>Rick Danheiser</p>\n<p>A.

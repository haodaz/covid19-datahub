In light of current public health guidance, and in an effort to provide these programs and their potential participants with sufficient time to plan, we have made the following decision:</p>\n<p>MIT will not host or sponsor any in-person K-12 student programming during the summer of 2020. This includes:</p>\n<p>on-campus programs operated by MIT</p>\n<p>on-campus programs run by external vendors who rent space from MIT</p>\n<p>off-campus programs that send MIT students, staff, and faculty into local, national, and global communities to work with K-12 students</p>\n<p>Remote programming is allowed and encouraged: summer programs that wish to move to an online format should begin planning to do so as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>This guidance does not apply to programs working exclusively with adults in the K-12 sector (e.g., teacher training and professional development), although future guidance and restrictions on adult programming may be forthcoming.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology","tags":null,"link":"https://covid19.mit.edu/k-12-summer-programming-update"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c56c6d7e-7c97-5a82-a78f-0002199140de"}}}

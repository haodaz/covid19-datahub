We hope this helps to limit any financial hardship you may face as a result of this transition.</p>\n<p>The credit will be placed on your student account in the next few weeks. Once the credit has been processed, you will receive a notification from student accounts. After your credit is placed on your student account, a refund request can be made or the credit may remain on the account and be applied towards your housing for a future semester.</p>\n<p>Please stay informed of the latest updates and prioritize your health and safety over the weeks to come.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Mark Diaz</p>\n<p>Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</p>\n<p>Cissy Petty</p>\n<p>Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"COVID-19 Update: Housing Credit for Spring 2020","tags":null,"link":"https://campusadvisories.gwu.edu/covid-19-update-housing-credit-spring-2020"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"5b2dcd30-82c2-595d-b897-23a7511feeea"}}}

Therefore, we are changing our plans and will hold in-person, on-campus, university-wide Commencement events for all of this yearâ€™s graduates when it is safe to do so.</p>\n<p>Our decision to hold a virtual Commencement was based on the obvious health danger of a physical gathering in May. While this still holds true, you have made it clear that a delay is far preferable to moving the event online. I appreciate your feedback and your patience as we navigate uncharted waters during this unprecedented health crisis.</p>\n<p>I look forward to seeing you in person on campus for the Commencement ceremonies you deserve.</p>\n<p>I hope you and your families and friends stay healthy during the difficult time ahead.</p>\n<p>Best wishes,</p>\n<p>Tony Monaco</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Important Announcement about Commencement for 2020 Graduates","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.tufts.edu/03-30-2020-commencement-update/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"2431e712-8f8c-553f-ad7b-025ff6c9f526"}}}

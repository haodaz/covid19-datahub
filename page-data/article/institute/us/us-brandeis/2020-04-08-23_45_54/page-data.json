We have heard from hundreds of you since making the decision that our usual Commencement exercises could not go forward on May 17. It is abundantly clear that you feel strongly about coming together in person to be honored and to celebrate with one another, family, and friends.</p>\n<p>I want to let you know that we will indeed have an on-campus Commencement celebration at some point in the next academic year. We do not yet know when this will happen, or the details, but when we do, we will of course let you know. Once again, we are taking suggestions about what that celebration might look like â€” should we retain the traditions of the past? Add something new? While I cannot promise we can implement your ideas, please free to share your thoughts through this link.</p>\n<p>Please stay safe and in touch with one another as much as you can.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ron Liebowitz</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 23, 2020","title":"Updated information related to Commencement","tags":null,"link":"https://www.brandeis.edu/health/coronavirus/2020-03-23-updated-information-related-to-commencement.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"a2f57243-f5a0-5dd1-8f44-caa790c3f180"}}}

This action comes following last weekâ€™s decision to suspend instruction for two weeks to ensure business and instructional continuity, and to allow further state assessment of COVID-19.</p>\n<p>Students are not allowed to return to campus until they receive permission from their institution, which will be forthcoming soon.</p>\n<p>Additionally, residence halls will be closed, with minimal exceptions for students unable to return home, or who cannot find housing elsewhere. Students will receive specific instructions from campus leaders regarding when they will be allowed to return to campus to retrieve their belongings from residence halls. Students must follow those instructions. For those students who are unable to depart campus, we will make every effort to accommodate these students.</p>\n<p>USG will be providing guidance to campuses on refunds for housing, dining, and other services. Students should wait for their campus to contact them.</p>\n<p>Institutions will remain open, with minimal staff physically on-site, to ensure continuity of certain services.</p>\n<p>In the end, we want to ensure that our faculty, staff and students are safe; that we do our part to help stem the spread of the coronavirus in Georgia; and that we fulfill our mission to graduate our students even in the face of these challenging times.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 16, 2020","title":"USG Moves to Online Instruction for Remainder of Semester","tags":null,"link":"http://health.gatech.edu/coronavirus#utm_source=gatech_home&utm_medium=banner&utm_campaign=coronavirus_campus"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1c9e476d-4e88-5897-a37e-97e2d34dc45a"}}}

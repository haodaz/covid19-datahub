Students participated through a Student Bar Association survey, an Information and Listening session with the dean and members of the law school’s response team, their representatives at the faculty and curriculum committee meetings, and individual emails. This mandatory credit/no credit approach is also the one most widely taken by law schools around the country.</p>\n<p>Penn State Law is providing extensive guidance to students about the spring 2020 grading policy through its memo on grading changes and FAQs. The Career Services Office is also working individually with students and employers and holding information sessions for students to help them navigate this challenging time.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 02, 2020","title":"Penn State Law in University Park announces spring 2020 grading policy changes","tags":null,"link":"https://news.psu.edu/story/614016/2020/04/02/academics/penn-state-law-university-park-announces-spring-2020-grading"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"40875550-25ec-5947-9f59-29b7749fa005"}}}

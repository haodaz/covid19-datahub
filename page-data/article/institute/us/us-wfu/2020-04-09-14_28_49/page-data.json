Today we are providing a FAQ to address emerging questions about the process, so you can begin your deliberations about whether or not to select the Pass/Fail mode for your courses in the future. Read the entries carefully, take the intervening days to assess your experience with remote learning and your specific circumstances, and be prepared to make your elections sometime after Monday, April 6, 2020.</p>\n<p>If you develop further questions, please consult your lower division advisers, your major/minor advisers, departments, the Office of Academic Advising and the Office of the University Registrar. This process, like so much else in this remarkable period, is evolving, and we will update the FAQ as needed on the OAA and OUR sites.

This represents a significant departure from our traditional practice with Pass/Fail grading, but our earlier message noted the truly remarkable circumstances the university community faces, along with the rest of the globe.</p>\n<p>As expected, faculty and staff have very quickly generated a host of questions about the implications of this move. We are providing both a FAQ list addressing the questions raised by and anticipated for faculty and staff and the FAQ for students, which addresses their myriad questions and will be useful to faculty and staff and to those among you who advise students. </p>\n<p>This process, like so much else in this remarkable period, is evolving, and you will receive additional information as we confirm the details of our grade mode election process. We will also update the FAQ as needed on the OAA and OUR sites. If you generate additional questions, please contact the Office of Academic Advising and the Office of the University Registrar. </p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Eric Ashley Hairston<br>\nAssociate Dean for Academic Advising<br>\nAssociate Professor of Interdisciplinary Humanities</p>\n<p>Michele Gillespie<br>\nDean of the College</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"College Pass/Fail FAQs (faculty and students)","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.wfu.edu/university-communications/college-pass-fail-faqs-faculty-and-students/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"945bc82a-d66c-5b60-9f0c-cb466c3631cb"}}}

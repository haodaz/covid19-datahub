Undergraduate and graduate student employees are not to report to their on-campus employer for the remainder of the spring semester. Remote work is NOT permitted. Students will be automatically paid for their regularly scheduled hours at their authorized pay rate. Pay checks will be distributed on scheduled pay dates already determined by the LMU Payroll calendar. Student employees will be paid either until their current Student Employment Authorization (SEA) award amount is exhausted or at the authorized SEA end date, whichever comes first.</p>\n<p>For specific questions, please contact Student Employment Services at (310) 338-7606.</p>\n<p>Student Psychological Services</p>\n<p>Student Psychological Services (SPS) remains committed to supporting student well-being and resilience.

Based on guidance received from DHSâ€™s Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP), we can confirm that student visa status will not be impacted by the emergency transition to distance learning for normally in-person classes. International Students can temporarily engage in distance-learning, either from within the U.S. or outside the country. However, please be advised that your F-1 visa regulations still apply, and international students must continue to make normal progress in a full course of study as required by federal regulations.</p>\n<p>Students Graduating in May Wishing to Apply for OPT</p>\n<p>Current federal regulations require that you must be physically present in the U.S. at the time you apply for OPT. You can leave the U.S. while the application is pending. Your application must provide a mailing address in the U.S., where USCIS can send any correspondence related to your application. It is essential that this address be valid for three to five months and that the person receiving the mail must be at that address to receive the mail and forward it to you.</p>\n<p>Online Courses</p>\n<p>Faculty are being encouraged to provide asynchronous methods of learning to accommodate students in different time zones. If your courses remain at the regularly scheduled time, please contact your professor for advice on how you can navigate this successfully. The Keep Learning Website serves as our student portal for accessing technology support resources and guidance for online learning.</p>\n<p>Housing</p>\n<p>International students should return home if they choose to, or remain in Los Angeles in their off-campus residences. We understand that some students living on-campus will not be able to return to their home countries. Students in this situation may petition for an exception to remain on campus and these requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis. Residents petitioning to remain in student housing must submit requests by 5 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17.

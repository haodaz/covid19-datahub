The spread of COVID-19 around the world is an unprecedented event, and we know that for some of you, it may feel especially overwhelming.</p>\n<p>For those of you who have received permission from the university to remain on campus as the university has shifted to a remote learning environment, this time can pose some unique challenges. As public health officials ask all Americans to practice social distancing, we understand that students may begin to experience feelings of loneliness. These feelings may only be exacerbated by the fact that some of you are far away from family and friends back home.</p>\n<p>Though we have scaled back some of our on-campus services, we want all of our students to know that we continue to offer an array of health and wellness resources that can provide medical advice, emotional support and more.</p>\n<p>If you are feeling ill, please contact our Health &#x26; Wellness Center at 610-758-3870. Our staff can assist you in determining a plan of care and ensure that you are taking every precaution necessary to keep yourself and your fellow students safe.</p>\n<p>If you find yourself feeling frightened, sad, or frustrated, we encourage you to reach out to those most familiar and close to you as well as offer to be there for others. In addition, if you think it might be helpful to talk things through with a counselor, we welcome you to contact our Office of Counseling and Psychological Services at 610-758-3880 or 610-758-5183. The center is open and counselors are available 24/7 to talk and provide support and assistance.</p>\n<p>We are appreciative and proud of the way our students have responded during a time of immense challenge, especially through your cooperation in terms of social distancing. This situation has tested and will continue to test us all, as individuals and as a community. By taking care of ourselves, and each other, we can all do our part to get through thisâ€”together.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Ian Birky</p>\n<p>Director, University Counseling &#x26; Psychological Services</p>\n<p>David Rubenstein</p>\n<p>Executive Director, Health &#x26; Wellness Center</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 25, 2020","title":"3.24.20: Message to Students Currently Residing On Campus","tags":null,"link":"https://www2.lehigh.edu/news/32420-message-to-students-currently-residing-on-campus"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"6f0c78d7-0360-5bdd-9781-8f7b91626233"}}}

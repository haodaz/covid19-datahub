As a result, to assist you with securing other opportunities by advancing your education at Rensselaer, we are extending the application deadline for graduating seniors to apply to the Co-Terminal program. The application deadline for graduating seniors is May 1st. Additionally, we have streamlined the application process to make it easier for graduating seniors to apply to the program.</p>\n<p>If you wish to be considered for admission to the Co-Terminal program, please complete the online application that can be found here.</p>\n<p>Additional instructions are available in the online application. Department-specific GPA requirements are listed here. Please note that we are waiving all other department-specific requirements, such as the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) and Letters of Recommendation, for this admission cycle only.</p>\n<p>The Co-Terminal program allows you to earn a masterâ€™s degree in two semesters (three semesters for the MBA), with an extension of your eligible undergraduate Rensselaer funding for those semesters. We strongly recommend that you contact the Office of Financial Aid at finaid@rpi.edu to discuss the specifics of your financial aid package.</p>\n<p>If you have any questions about the application process, please contact Mr. Steven Atkinson, Sr. Student Services Administrator in the Office of Graduate Education, at atkins3@rpi.edu.</p>\n<p>Thank you, and we wish you and your family the best during this difficult time.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Jonathan D.

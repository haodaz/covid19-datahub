Any remaining credit will be disbursed to you. If you have signed up for direct deposit, funds will be credited to your selected bank account. If you have not signed up for direct deposit, a check will be sent to your mailing address. I urge you to sign up for direct deposit through Banner’s eServices, if you have not already done so.</p>\n<p>The portal will also give you the option to donate your remaining rebate balance back to William &#x26; Mary to support students in need. This option was provided at the request of fellow students who desired to forego their rebates. In order to donate, you must indicate your decision to do so no later than Sunday, April 5, which will provide W&#x26;M time to process the donation. Otherwise, we will assume that you do not wish to donate at this time, and you will receive the rebate credit.</p>\n<p>If you are experiencing dire financial need this semester, the university may be able to help. Please contact deanofstudents@wm.edu for more information and to discuss your options.</p>\n<p>Thank you again for your patience as William &#x26; Mary finalized the policy and processes that enabled us to issue student rebates.

The global novel coronavirus pandemic has William &#x26; Mary exploring how best to acknowledge the necessary changes to our current learning and working environments. This remains a very fluid situation. With that in mind, I wanted to provide an update about what to expect in the coming days.</p>\n<p>The William &#x26; Mary Finance Office is finalizing the process of distributing student rebates and will communicate specifics with students via email no later than Thursday, April 2. Having concluded this process, the university has made the decision to offer rebates to all students with a university housing contract, meal plan and/or parking pass, regardless of the use of institutional aid.</p>\n<p>Housing Rebates – Students will receive a rebate based on their housing type as follows:</p>\n<p>Main Campus – All Room Types $1,200</p>\n<p>New Campus – Doubles &#x26; Triples $1,200</p>\n<p>New Campus – Singles $1,350</p>\n<p>Single Buyouts $1,350</p>\n<p>All Graduate Housing $1,350</p>\n<p>Tribe Square $1,350</p>\n<p>Resident assistants will receive $1200.</p>\n<p>Meal Plans – Students will receive rebates based on their spring semester meal plan as follows:</p>\n<p>Gold 19 and Freedom Plans $ 460</p>\n<p>Block 175 $ 420</p>\n<p>Block 125 $ 340</p>\n<p>Block 100 $ 270</p>\n<p>Commuter 50 $ 100</p>\n<p>Commuter 25 $ 50</p>\n<p>In addition, any remaining balance of dining dollars as of March 25 will be refunded. Rebate amounts for meal plans reflect adjustments for university costs incurred.</p>\n<p>Parking – Students with a 2019-2020 parking decal will receive a rebate of $54. Students do not need to surrender their parking decals to receive the rebate.</p>\n<p>Rebates will be applied to your student account on or before Friday, April 10, through direct deposit or via check if you are not currently enrolled in direct deposit. To ensure a fast and secure refund, please sign up for direct deposit through Banner’s eServices.</p>\n<p>Be well,</p>\n<p>Amy Sebring</p>\n<p>Vice President for Finance and Technology</p>\n<p>Back to the top</p>\n<p>A Message to Students from Vice President for Student Affairs Ginger Ambler</p>\n<p>March 23, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Students,</p>\n<p>​This is not the spring semester any of us could have envisioned. We surely are living in unprecedented times, and I’d like to take a moment to acknowledge the uncertainty that many of us are facing due to the rapid pace of change occurring not only at W&#x26;M, but also in our local communities, nationally, and globally. Now more than ever, I trust that our powerful sense of community will help sustain us, even as we adapt to new ways of connecting, learning, and affirming belonging.​</p>\n<p>​As the week begins here in Williamsburg, our top priority is supporting students as on-line learning commences and as we prepare for the closing of Residence Halls on Wednesday. Some of you have sought to understand better our decision not to keep any dorms open, especially for international students. We continue to be guided first and foremost by the advice of our local health authorities. Indeed, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our community. Given the growing number of Covid-19 cases in our surrounding area, including in our campus community, we recognized that our residence halls are unsuitable for long term self-quarantine and self-isolation, which will be necessary in the weeks ahead; additionally, we are not staffed to provide a high level of health care and living support for students under pandemic conditions.​</p>\n<p>​Students who are having difficulty implementing their personal evacuation plans under these unprecedented circumstances, will be helped on an individual basis, and we will deploy emergency funds wherever possible to ease the financial burden as students await housing, dining, and parking rebates (detailed information about rebates will be sent soon in a separate message). A compilation of resources was created and shared last week with all students who had alerted us to their urgent need; the Dean of Students and Reves Center teams are following up with those students by phone today to determine what needs have yet to be met. All students who alerted us should be contacted by the end of the day. Many of you have reached out and expressed compassion and concern for your fellow students who may be in need -- please be assured that no student will be without shelter when the residence halls close on March 25. If you, yourself, are a dorm resident who is having difficulty with your plan for moving out by Wednesday and you have not notified the Dean of Students Office, please do so right away by clicking here. ​</p>\n<p>​It is my sincere hope that each of you will tap into tools and resources that you have found work best for you during trying times. Below are some additional resources that you may find helpful as you transition to our new online educational environment:​</p>\n<p>From Health &#x26; Wellness​</p>\n<p>​The departments of Health &#x26; Wellness have created a Virtual Health &#x26; Wellness site. We have posted programs, videos and articles to enhance your wellness and resilience, including live wellness and fitness programs. Last week over 160 people join our first live, remote yoga class! Our live programs will be recorded to be used at your convenience. Be sure to visit our Virtual Health &#x26; Wellness site where you will find an article by Dr. Kelly Crace on Flourishing during Unexpected, Uncertain, and Unwanted Change. And please download the W&#x26;M Wellness App to stay current on all events and resources.​</p>\n<p>From the Dean of Students Office​</p>\n<p>While William &#x26; Mary is operating on a modified academic schedule, all the departments of the Dean of Students Office are available via phone (757) 221-2510 and email. Additionally, we will have the capability of scheduling meetings with students remotely via phone or Zoom. We want to support your success as we transition online. If you need assistance, please do not hesitate to visit our website for a full listing of our departments to help in your success.​</p>\n<p>Resources:</p>\n<p>In the days and weeks ahead, stay connected with us and with one another. We will continue to reach out to you with updates and information we think you may find useful. Best wishes as W&#x26;M moves forward into this new virtual educational environment. Remember that we are in this together -- all W&#x26;M offices are \"open\" and we are here for you.​</p>\n<p>Yours,​</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler​</p>\n<p>​Virginia M. Ambler, PhD​</p>\n<p>Vice President for Student Affairs​</p>\n<p>William &#x26; Mary</p>\n<p>Back to the top</p>\n<p>Update for Students from Vice President Ambler</p>\n<p>March 16, 2020</p>\n<p>Dear Students,</p>\n<p>Below I share the additional details and guidance promised earlier today in the message you received from President Rowe and me related to directives from the Governor’s Office. As previously noted, we strongly advise all students to physically leave campus if they can. During the period of time where the university and its campuses are not open to the public, we will continue to provide essential services as best we can.</p>\n<p>Please keep the following in mind:</p>\n<p>All Students</p>\n<p>Questions About COVID-19 Response. The best source for updated information regarding the university’s response to COVID-19 remains the online Q&#x26;A by the university at www.wm.edu/coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if you have questions directly related to the impact of COVID-19 in the Williamsburg/Peninsula area, state and local health authorities have set up two Call Centers:</p>\n<p>The Peninsula Health Department call center at 757-594-7069</p>\n<p>The Southside Health Department call center at 757-683-2745</p>\n<p>Pass/Fail Expansion. As we prepare to change our instructional delivery modes starting next week, we are expanding the pass-fail option for Spring 2020. Degree-seeking academic juniors and seniors may elect Pass/Fail grading for up to two normally-graded courses; academic freshmen and sophomores may elect to take one normally-graded course on a Pass/Fail basis this semester. If you intend to select Pass/Fail, you must do so in Banner during the extended withdrawal period, which now ends on Monday March 30 at 11:59 pm. See the student FAQ section at www.wm.edu/coronavirus for additional details.</p>\n<p>Room Selection. At this time room selection for returning students for the 2020-2021 Academic Year will proceed on schedule online, including Priority Housing.</p>\n<p>If you have direct questions for Residence Life, all communications have been sent to student W&#x26;M emails and shared via our Residence Life website. Please know that although the Residence Life office is closed to the general public they will still be responding to emails sent to living@wm.edu. However, please expect delays in responses due to high volume.</p>\n<p>Wellness Resources for You. Our Health &#x26; Wellness team is working to create a Virtual Wellness Center that includes a variety of wellness and fitness resources for students to access online. From exercise, personal training, and yoga videos to mindfulness and creative art, we will be offering a wide range of resources to help you manage the stress and emotions that are a part of this new challenge. For those who want to use this time to deepen their learning on various wellness areas, we will be providing educational resources on a wide range of topics, including managing cabin fever. Give us a couple more days to complete and compile our videos and then check in frequently on our main website, www.wm.edu/offices/wellness, or download our new W&#x26;M Wellness App! Simply browse our wellness departments' resource pages or our App and dive into something that speaks to you. For instance, this may be a great time to learn about our online training modules on mental health via SilverCloud (<a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/ohp/general-wellness/silvercloud/\">https://www.wm.edu/offices/wellness/ohp/general-wellness/silvercloud/</a>).</p>\n<p>Students Away from Campus</p>\n<p>Access to personal items. In accordance with the governor’s directive, access to residence halls for pick-up of personal items left over spring break is temporarily suspended while the campus and campus offices are closed to the public. Faculty will be flexible about academic materials (textbooks and the like) that you do not have access to. Barnes &#x26; Noble, through VitalSource, has made arrangements for students to have free access to eTextbooks. Here are two web resources that provide additional information:</p>\n<p>Connecting remotely to campus IT resources. We are working to identify and support any students who might have equipment, connectivity or other assistance needs in accessing online instruction. Please contact the Dean of Students Office for assistance. Additionally, if you do not have WiFi connectivity or access to the internet and currently have a cellular phone, you may want to contact your carrier to determine if your phone has the ability to serve as a mobile hotspot.</p>\n<p>IT has set up the web resource that may also be helpful, <a href=\"https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/remoteresources/index.php\">https://www.wm.edu/offices/it/remoteresources/index.php</a>.</p>\n<p>Students Remaining on Campus Due to Extenuating Circumstances</p>\n<p>Group Gatherings. We are asking residents who remain on campus due to extenuating circumstances not to gather in groups. Medical advice at this time is that interaction is limited to immediate circle groups only. In our residential setting, we interpret this as roommate/suitemate groups. Do not gather socially in larger groups in your residence halls, across campus or in locations in the community. Remaining on campus and utilizing university resources while practicing social distancing - remaining 6 to 8 feet from other individuals is preferred.</p>\n<p>Building Access. Carry your keys and ID with you every time you leave the room. Residence Life staff will be unable to respond to lockout requests. You are responsible for locking your doors and carrying your keys. In an emergency situation, WMPD will help with a lockout, but we need this to be a last resort.</p>\n<p>Building Hours. Please note new hours for the Post Office in Sadler and the Student Health Center:</p>\n<p>The Post Office will be open from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays and is accessible from the west door of the Sadler Center.</p>\n<p>The Student Health Center remains open to students by appointment only. Students should call ahead to schedule an appointment.</p>\n<p>Dining Services. Commons is set up as a to-go option only and no self-service. Food is either pre-packaged or boxed by dining staff and is available 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 p.m. to 8 p.m. Tribe Market is open 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Chick-fil-A is to-go only, no indoor seating.</p>\n<p>Duty Office Hours. Duty Offices in Residence Halls will remain closed at this time.</p>\n<p>Emergencies. Emergencies need to be directed to the W&#x26;M Police at 757-221-4596.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience and support as we move through these challenging days together.</p>\n<p>Yours,</p>\n<p>Ginger Ambler</p>\n<p>Back to the top</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"COVID messages to students","tags":null,"link":"https://www.wm.edu/news/announcements/2020/covid-messages-from-student-affairs.php#march30"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"7d19df3e-20be-514b-bd6c-746a97c03b35"}}}

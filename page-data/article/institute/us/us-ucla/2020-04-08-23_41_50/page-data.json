For many UCLA students, no experience is more valued than celebrating the culmination of their hard work and dedication along with their families and friends during graduation ceremonies.</p>\n<p>As we all work to limit the spread of COVID-19, it has become increasingly clear that we will not be able to gather in person for spring 2020 commencement ceremonies, so the College commencement, doctoral hooding ceremony and all campus graduation ceremonies will be adapted to be virtual events.</p>\n<p>Our decisions to transition to remote learning and suspend all nonessential events of any size through the end of the spring quarter have been driven entirely by our desire to protect the health and safety of our community, which includes all of the family and friends who would have joined us at our commencement ceremonies.</p>\n<p>For the UCLA College, whose commencement is UCLA’s largest, we will hold an engaging virtual ceremony on June 12, 2020. Consistent with our tradition, the ceremony will feature an inspiring keynote speaker, whose name will be announced soon. The College will offer new opportunities to connect our graduates in a variety of ways that further enhance the virtual event.</p>\n<p>As we move into a spring quarter of remote learning, please know that we are actively exploring how we might enhance the student experience while everyone is away from campus, particularly for our seniors.</p>\n<p>For the soon-to-be graduates of UCLA, in the weeks ahead, we will provide additional information about how we will mark their important accomplishments.</p>\n<p>Campus leadership will be in touch with the schools and departments that hold individual commencements to provide support where possible. We will share more details about those efforts as soon as we are able.</p>\n<p>Please remember that, even for an event as momentous as commencement, the day does not define the journey. We will work diligently to make graduation as special as possible for all of our students and all of your loved ones. Even when we are apart, we remain deeply connected as Bruins, and I look forward to celebrating your accomplishments this spring.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Plans for Spring 2020 Commencement Ceremonies","tags":null,"link":"https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/plans-spring-2020-commencement-ceremonies/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c994d1cf-56c8-528d-84f6-a1c62fcfa2b0"}}}

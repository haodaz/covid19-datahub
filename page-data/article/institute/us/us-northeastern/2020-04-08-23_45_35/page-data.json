Consistent with the university’s rich tradition, we will feature an inspiring address from a pioneering individual who has expanded the frontiers of human knowledge, possibility, and achievement. And we also plan to offer new opportunities for interconnecting the Northeastern family in ways that further enrich this virtual event.</p>\n<p>We will also extend our celebration by scheduling special gatherings for our graduates and their families in communities around the world, when we are once again able to meet face-to-face, hand-to-hand. These celebrations will of course acknowledge our law school graduates, newly minted PhDs, and CPS grads.</p>\n<p>In the weeks ahead, we will provide the proud members of the Class of 2020 and their families with more information about our ongoing plans to hail their memorable moment of accomplishment—and new beginnings.</p>\n<p>Let us remember that Northeastern is about experience without boundaries. As such, honoring the impact of our community is not bounded by time or place. As this graduation year, 2020, marches on—we will celebrate the remarkable achievements of Northeastern graduates, past and present, every day.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Joseph E.

All Spring 2020 undergraduate courses are eligible for Pass/Fail, including those being used to satisfy major and minor requirements, and to fulfill NUpath requirements. Students may petition for up to two Spring 2020 undergraduate courses to be graded using the Pass/Fail option.</p>\n<p>Instructions for how to petition for Pass/Fail may be found on the Registrar’s website. Students should consult with their academic advisors if they have questions about the implications of opting for Pass/Fail grading.</p>\n<p>Please be advised that this policy modification does not apply to graduate students, School of Law students, and College of Professional Studies students. It remains at the discretion of these schools and colleges to determine whether their respective Pass/Fail policies will be adjusted.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your commitment to bringing the Spring 2020 semester to a successful conclusion and for your continued flexibility and understanding during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Regards,</p>\n<p>James C.

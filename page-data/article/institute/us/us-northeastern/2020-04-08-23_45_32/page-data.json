We want you to know we have heard you. We understand how much this moment matters to you and your families, as the culmination of years of hard work and high achievement.</p>\n<p>Based on your feedback, we are working hard to find alternate dates and venues for in-person celebrations with you and your loved ones. We will develop plans based on your input and the evolving global situation. Please know that we are committed to hosting celebrations at all of our global campus locations at a future date, including Boston, Charlotte, London, Seattle, San Francisco, San Jose, Toronto and Vancouver. We also plan to find opportunities to celebrate in New York, Philadelphia, Austin, San Diego, Dubai, Hong Kong, and other locations as travel opens up.</p>\n<p>We, too, are deeply disappointed that we are unable to hold our in-person events this spring. We are buoyed by your responses, that you would be willing to rejoin us at a later date. In the meantime, you will, of course, receive your diplomas by mail this year. You will also receive a special mailing with commemorative items. Please be sure to hold on to those; youâ€™ll want them for the festive events to come.</p>\n<p>Times of unprecedented challenge have a way of bringing out the best in the Northeastern community. This has never been more true. We are looking to you to bring us your best ideas for making these celebrations memorable and meaningful for you and your families.

We continue to be here to support you and celebrate you. We are one Northeastern.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>James C.

On-campus residents are defined as students living in Drexel residences or fraternity and sorority housing.

Students who have left campus for the lengthened spring break and/or are unable to return to campus by Friday, March 20, 2020, will have the option to leave their personal belongings in their room assignment. Students who leave their belongings in their rooms do so at their own risk, although Drexel Public Safety will continue to secure and check in on all residences. The University shall not be liable for any loss or damage to a resident’s personal property, whether such loss or damage is caused by fire or another casualty, theft, or any other cause. Housing and Residence Life will follow-up with more information in the upcoming weeks regarding coordination to remove personal belongings. The residence halls and Fraternity and Sorority Housing will remain inaccessible to students after Move-Out until further communication.</p>\n<p>Are residential students being asked to remove all personal belongings and move out completely?</p>\n<p>We have sent messages to all residential students about our move-out process, which started this week and was set to continue this weekend through next Wednesday, March 25. However, due to the governor’s order, we must move quickly to have students move out of Drexel housing as soon as possible. To that end, all Drexel residential students (other than those specifically noted below) will be required to leave their on-campus residence as soon as they complete their last final exam March 20. Residential students need to be out of Drexel housing by midnight on Friday, March 20, 2020. As noted in our recent messaging, students can leave their personal belongings in their current space. We will be back in contact with all on-campus students in the next few weeks with further details about a future move-out time. For the limited number of students who applied for an exemption for spring housing and were granted that request, please know that Drexel residence halls will remain open for all of you, as well as for those of you who are unable to leave campus until this weekend (or early next week) because of pre-existing travel arrangements.

Due to the governor’s order, we request that if there is anything you need from your campus office for your work that you pick it up in the morning and return home promptly thereafter. All faculty and professional staff should ensure they have everything they need to work remotely going forward.</p>\n<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>\n<p>Sincerely</p>\n<p>John Fry</p>\n<p>President</p>\n<p>Helen Y.

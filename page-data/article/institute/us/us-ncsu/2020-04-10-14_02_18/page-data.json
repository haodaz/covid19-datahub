This includes camps on NC State’s campus in Raleigh and at other locations.</p>\n<p>Attendees who have already registered and paid for camps will be contacted by the host regarding refund options. Several academic-focused camps are working to move their programs online; please check with the hosting college or unit for details. Existing online summer camps and activities will continue as previously planned.</p>\n<p>As the university anticipates the healthy return of students, faculty, staff and friends in the fall – on campus and at our programs across the state – we hope the timing of this camp decision provides students and parents with plenty of time to effectively plan for a productive and enjoyable summer.</p>\n<p>Please keep up with NC State COVID-19 related updates and information at www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus.</p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 03, 2020","title":"Summer 2020 NC State Academic, Athletic and 4-H Camps Update","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ncsu.edu/coronavirus/summer-2020-nc-state-academic-athletic-and-4-h-camps-update/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0835740c-105f-5da9-89bc-55a6bb532c07"}}}

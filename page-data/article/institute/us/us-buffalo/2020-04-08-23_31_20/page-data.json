Hernandez, Interim Vice President for Student Life</p>\n<p>Dear Students and Parents:</p>\n<p>The University has been working closely with SUNY leadership to quickly resolve the financial impact remote instruction, distance learning, and campus housing changes have on students and families.</p>\n<p>We are developing approaches to credit certain unused fees to a student's account. Our approach includes ensuring that decisions we make do not jeopardize any student's financial aid. Those impacts are currently under study and review.</p>\n<p>As previously communicated, resident students who leave campus housing this semester will receive a prorated credit for their housing effective March 23, 2020 through the end of their remaining housing contract.</p>\n<p>Students who have meal plan contracts or campus cash will receive a prorated credit for the balance remaining on their meal plan/campus cash on their student account as well.</p>\n<p>Students will receive prorated credits for certain other fees where services have been discontinued or curtailed due to the COVID-19 emergency. A calculated credit amount is being determined for each of these fees:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Transportation fee</li>\n<li>Athletics fee</li>\n<li>Recreation</li>\n<li>Campus Life Fee</li>\n<li>Student Activity Fee - to be determined by the applicable student government.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After these credits are applied to the student's account, a refund will be granted as applicable. Students anticipating a refund are encouraged to enroll in direct deposit, <a href=\"https://www.buffalo.edu/studentaccounts/refunds/refund-direct-deposit.html\">https://www.buffalo.edu/studentaccounts/refunds/refund-direct-deposit.html</a>. Absent a direct deposit on file a refund check will be issued and mailed to the student's permanent address.</p>\n<p>We realize this is a difficult, unexpected and unprecedented situation that we are all navigating together. Our goal is to finalize credits and applicable refunds as soon as possible and certainly before the end of the spring semester.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Business Guidance Related to COVID-19","tags":null,"link":"http://www.buffalo.edu/administrative-services/business-and-finance-guidance-related-to-covid-19.html#refunds-letter"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4ffead97-7634-5ad7-bfe5-846d62c5d6bf"}}}

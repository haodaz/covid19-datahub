In an effort to help students, distance education differential tuition will not be charged for online courses this summer at an individual course level. For distance education degree programs with a program fee, there is no change in how they will be charged.</p>\n<p>At this time, we are planning for traditional, face-to-face delivery in the second summer term with a back-up plan for online delivery depending on the length of the current situation. We will communicate final plans for the second summer session early enough for individuals to plan accordingly.</p>\n<p>Additionally, we are working to ensure we have a robust variety of summer coursework needed to make progress toward your degree.</p>\n<p>Registration begins March 30 and will continue as scheduled.</p>\n<p>As a reminder, please consult the central Texas A&#x26;M University page for regular updates as well as keeplearning.tamu.edu.</p>\n<p>Carol A. Fierke</p>\n<p>Provost and Executive Vice President</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Plans for Summer 2020 Course Offerings","tags":null,"link":"https://www.tamu.edu/coronavirus/plans-for-summer-2020-course-offerings.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9074142e-ae1a-5bed-b9d9-9f6e763bc2d7"}}}

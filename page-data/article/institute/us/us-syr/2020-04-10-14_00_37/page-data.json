It’s one our graduating students have worked tirelessly toward and one they’ve looked forward to cherishing with family and friends who helped them achieve this accomplishment. That is why I promised our 2020 graduates they would have a Commencement and would have an opportunity to influence the shape of this important event.</p>\n<p>After hearing from thousands of our students, I am pleased to share with you that this fall we will hold our 2020 Commencement in our stadium, after the roof replacement project is complete and once health officials advise large gatherings are once again safe. Graduating students overwhelmingly selected this option. It will be one of the first events held in this space. I promise you, we will make it special, meaningful and memorable. Our graduating students have earned it.</p>\n<p>As planning efforts get underway, I want to provide our graduating students with the reassurance of how their Commencement and other Commencement-related activities, including schools/college convocations, will move forward. I assure you that, as soon as we are able to finalize plans, we will share the details with you. In the meantime, here are three important dates to mark on your calendars:</p>\n<p>On April 13, you will receive specific information about how degrees will be conferred.</p>\n<p>On May 10, I will formally confer upon graduating students the academic degrees that have been approved by our Board of Trustees.</p>\n<p>By June 1, I anticipate being able to share more details about the fall Commencement.</p>\n<p>I appreciate the tremendous patience, understanding and flexibility our graduating students have demonstrated throughout this challenging time. And I look forward to marking your graduation with the ceremony and celebration that you deserve.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Chancellor Kent Syverud</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Commencement 2020 Update from Chancellor Syverud","tags":null,"link":"https://news.syr.edu/blog/2020/04/08/commencement-2020-update-from-chancellor-syverud/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"19b0b2bb-ac48-5015-83bd-ee4cf710b273"}}}

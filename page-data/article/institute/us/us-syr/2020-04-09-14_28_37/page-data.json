This option applies to all undergraduate courses except for University College online courses taught in the eight-week format. Please read my <a href=\"https://news.syr.edu/blog/2020/03/18/coronavirus-update-deadline-for-dropping-classes-and-switching-to-pass-fail-extended/\">message of March 22</a> for important issues to consider before choosing this option.</p>\n<p>Some members of the campus community have advocated to extend the deadline even further. We are unable to extend it beyond April 10. All of the change requests have to be entered into our student record management system prior to the submission of grades by faculty. Delaying grade reporting would result in a delay in the certification of degrees for our graduating seniors.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Chris Johnson<br>\nAssociate Provost for Academic Affairs</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2020","title":"Pass/Fail Grading Option Deadline Extended to Friday, April 10","tags":null,"link":"https://news.syr.edu/blog/2020/04/01/pass-fail-grading-option-deadline-extended-to-friday-april-10/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b00c65f5-8e0a-5022-ae5b-472f938cc07a"}}}

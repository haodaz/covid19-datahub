The grade cut-off for a “P” will be the same as the traditional grade minimum for students to receive course credit, which is a C-.</p>\n<p>Students who are interested will be able to request that their “P” for a course be converted to a letter grade through a process that will be described in greater detail in the weeks to come. Such requests must be made by July 1.</p>\n<p>Students who receive “No Record Covid,” or “NRC,” will receive no course credit, but their grade point average will not be affected. Language will be added to transcripts explaining the university’s policy this term.</p>\n<p>This new policy also applies to undergraduates enrolled in graduate courses, but would not apply to classes graded before March 10.</p>\n<p>Lastly, the university will institute a more flexible withdrawal policy, allowing students to withdraw from a course up until April 21 and not have the course appear on their transcript.</p>\n<p>We plan to share additional information regarding graduate and professional coursework grading policies next week.</p>\n<p>While other institutions across the nation have adopted similar policies on grading, it is undoubtedly an unprecedented step for the University of Michigan. But these are unprecedented times, and I appreciate your flexibility.</p>\n<p>You should expect to receive additional information and guidance from your school or college next week. In the meantime, remember that <a href=\"https://coronavirus.umich.edu/\">https://coronavirus.umich.edu/</a> is our hub for all news and updates regarding the ongoing COVID-19 situation.</p>\n<p>Please take good care of yourselves, and those around you, during this challenging time.</p>\n<p>Susan M.

Maggitti, PhD</p>\n<p>Provost</p>\n<p>Spring 2020 Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory (S/U) Grading Option Details (see also: FAQs for Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory Grading FAQs for Spring 2020)</p>\n<p>All undergraduate and graduate students may select S/U grading for one or more of their courses, including those that were designed from the beginning to be online. The Fitzpatrick College of Nursing will award S/U for all clinical practice courses rather than allow students to choose. The University and colleges have waived the normal rules restricting the use of S/U grading in Spring 2020 as follows: There is no limit on the number of courses for which a student may choose S/U grading. Courses in which a student earns an S grade will count toward the core curriculum, major, minor or certificate. All undergraduate students, including those in their first year, may choose S/U grading. The signature of the student’s adviser is not required for a student to select S/U grading. However, students are encouraged to consult with their advisers or staff in their colleges’ advising offices before electing this option. The S/U grade will continue to not count toward a student’s GPA. The S grade value remains a C grade or better; the U grade is for a C- or lower. Students have until the day after final grades are due to decide to use S/U grading in one or more of their courses. This approach allows students to see their final grades and then decide if they want to use S/U grading in a course. For the large majority of students, the deadline will be May 12, 2020. Note: Some courses using a non-standard academic calendar will have a different deadline. The student’s decision to select S/U grading is final. In order to select S/U grading, students must complete and submit an online form. The Office of the Registrar will notify students when the form is available.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"March 25 Message from the Provost","tags":null,"link":"https://www1.villanova.edu/villanova/studentlife/health/center/Coronavirus/mar-25-grading-options-spring-2020.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"8613f279-eb84-5a16-9448-0b2d88d0dea8"}}}

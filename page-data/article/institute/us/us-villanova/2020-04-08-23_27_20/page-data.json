There was one line in the reflection that struck me, particularly given the unprecedented times we currently face. It read “If I were allowed only one prayer, it would be for my daughters’ safety and happiness.” It is with this thought in mind that I am writing to share an update regarding Villanova’s response to the global outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>First, I want to state that there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Villanova’s campus. However, beginning on Monday, March 16, 2020, all in-person classes will be suspended, and classes will be taught solely online. Students may return home if they choose to do so. The University will remain open and employees are expected to report to work. We take these measures out of an abundance of caution in order to safeguard the well-being of our students, faculty and staff.</p>\n<p>While exact specifics are currently being determined, the details of this decision are as follows:</p>\n<p>Beginning Monday, March 16, 2020, all in-person classes meeting on campus will be suspended.</p>\n<p>In-person classes will meet as scheduled through Friday, March 13. Classes will be held tomorrow and Friday so that faculty can orient students regarding how they will conduct their online classes. These two days will also allow for students who wish to return home to do so.</p>\n<p>Faculty have prepared for this potential scenario. Therefore, starting on Monday, March 16, courses will be taught solely online.</p>\n<p>Students have the option to return home or remain on campus to complete their online instruction.</p>\n<p>Students with lab or clinical requirements should contact their professors directly to discuss their completion.</p>\n<p>We will continue to monitor and evaluate the situation, and will decide no later than Friday, April 3, whether to resume in-person classes. If we were to resume, it would be following the Easter break on Tuesday, April 14.</p>\n<p>During this time, Villanova remains open and operational.</p>\n<p>All employees should report to work, as University operations will continue. Human Resources will contact University departments and offices to develop plans for alternative work scenarios as circumstances warrant.</p>\n<p>University services—including residence halls, dining facilities, academic support services, the Student Health Center, the University Counseling Center and Falvey Library—will remain open.</p>\n<p>All non-classroom activities, including faculty research, will continue. Students may continue to work with faculty in their labs if they choose to do so. Students doing externships and internships should consult with the program director.</p>\n<p>University and College events are canceled as of Saturday, March 14.</p>\n<p>All University and College events are canceled as of Saturday, March 14, through at least April 14.</p>\n<p>This includes any on-campus lectures, meetings, conferences, admissions events and student-run events.</p>\n<p>Villanova Athletics will continue with normal operations (practices and games), but all on-campus contests and competitions will be spectator-free at least through April 14.</p>\n<p>The University encourages community members to minimize social interactions in large groups, both on campus and off campus.</p>\n<p>University-related international travel is suspended.</p>\n<p>Any University-sponsored international travel is being suspended until further notice.</p>\n<p>Any student, faculty or staff member returning from a Level 2 or 3 CDC country must self-isolate at home for 14 days.</p>\n<p>Any faculty or staff member currently traveling on University business can return to campus if they have traveled to Level 1 CDC countries.</p>\n<p>traveling on University business can return to campus if they have traveled to Level 1 CDC countries.

This period of online classes will limit interactions and hopefully allow us to see reductions in the spread of COVID-19 in the Philadelphia region and throughout the country. I thank you for your patience and understanding as we navigate these unprecedented times, particularly as the situation continues to evolve.</p>\n<p>During this Lenten season, you remain in my thoughts and prayers, along with all of those affected by this virus.

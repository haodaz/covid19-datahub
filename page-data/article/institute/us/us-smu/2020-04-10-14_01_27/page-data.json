Enrollment for May and June classes for current SMU students opens Monday, April 13, and the priority enrollment deadline is Friday, April 24.</p>\n<p>The University has not yet decided how classes scheduled to start in July will be offered. Courses that start in July are currently listed in the Schedule of Classes as taking place on campus, but this is under review. Enrollment opens on April 13th for all summer courses including those that start in July. Students enrolling in a summer course that starts in July need to be aware that the delivery of the course may change. An announcement will be made later.</p>\n<p>Many of the courses previously listed for May term at SMU-in-Taos will be offered online, while others that are site-dependent, such as “Photography in Taos,” will not. None of the field school classes previously scheduled for June at SMU-in-Taos will be available. Students with questions about SMU-in Taos courses may contact Rumanda Young at rkyoung@smu.edu or Lashanda Phillips at lashandap@smu.edu.</p>\n<p>More than fifty percent of our SMU students who graduate in four years take advantage of the Intersession courses offered during breaks between semesters and over the summer. We understand that the availability of these courses is key to timely progress toward your degree and hope you will take full advantage of what is being offered online. May and June courses can provide opportunities for students whose internships have been cancelled or shortened due to COVID-19, and it’s not too late for students to request specific May/summer courses through the SMU Intersession “Wish List” or the SMU-in-Taos “Wish List.”</p>\n<p>Thank you for your patience as we continue to adapt to the changing health needs of our SMU community and neighbors.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Peter K. Moore</p>\n<p>Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs ad interim</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 06, 2020","title":"SMU May and June classes move online – Coronavirus (COVID-19)","tags":null,"link":"https://blog.smu.edu/coronavirus-covid-19/2020/04/06/smu-may-and-june-classes-move-online/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"ae812a3b-4e84-54dd-a6d4-8db2059e1a57"}}}

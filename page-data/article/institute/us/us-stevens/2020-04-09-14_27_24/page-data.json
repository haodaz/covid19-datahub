Some options also have the benefit of supporting local restaurants which have also been negatively affected by recent closures.</p>\n<p>As always when considering volunteering or making a donation, it is a good idea to review the organizationâ€™s web site, where available.  Some of the recent efforts to provide support have been launched as grassroots efforts by individuals and entities which are not charitable organizations.  The university is not endorsing or prioritizing any organization or individual effort, and we are not providing tax or other advice.  This information is being made available as a courtesy to all who might like to help in this time of need.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.hobokencc.org/foodpantry\">Hoboken Food Pantry</a><br>\nDonations of non-perishable items can be made at the Hoboken Food Pantry <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/Z5851ZAWNLQY/\">Amazon Wish List</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://hobokenshelter.org/\">Hoboken Shelter</a><br>\nDonations of non-perishable items can be made at the Hoboken Shelter <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/28CU0H1B5IWK2?ref_=cm_sw_r_cp_ep_ws_ydN7yb1AS0Z3C&#x26;pldnSite=1\">Amazon Wish List</a> or directly through their <a href=\"https://hobokenshelter.org/donating-to-the-shelter/\">website</a>.</li>\n<li>Hoboken First Responders<br>\nMeal donations to first responders including the Hoboken Police Department, Fire Department, and Volunteer Ambulance Corps can be made by contacting Detective Sergeant, Jonathan Mecka at <a href=\"mailto:meckaj@hobokenpd.org\">meckaj@hobokenpd.org</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/631298804317956/\">Front Line Appreciation Group</a> <strong>(FLAG) of Hoboken and Jersey City</strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/631298804317956/\">FLAG</a> is a grassroots effort that has been initiated to supply meals from Hoboken restaurants for first responders and medical personnel using Paypal and Venmo. </li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please respond directly to the organizations.</p>\n<h3>All Advisories, Updates &#x26; Campus Communications</h3>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 01, 2020","title":"Summer 2020 Semester to Be Held Online","tags":null,"link":"https://www.stevens.edu/directory/student-health-services/health-advisory-update/coronavirus-2019-covid-19-information"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4dda9b7b-0f24-58a4-a576-0c523d9684e7"}}}

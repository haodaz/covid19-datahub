This will include all study abroad programs, experiential travel, and other group travel for students and faculty. By making this decision now, our academic units will be in a better position to plan alternate academic opportunities that also benefit students. It will also allow our students the chance to consider other options if they had been planning an international experience this summer.</p>\n<p>Further, we are strongly recommending that all non-essential international and domestic employee travel be avoided until June 30.</p>\n<p>Recommendations about fall study abroad programs will be shared towards the end of April since course registrations for fall quarter begin in early May.</p>\n<p>We will continue to re-evaluate this travel policy and all related academic decisions, as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolds. In the meantime, in order to comply with this recommendation, we ask that any travel planning be suspended until we have additional information and guidelines to share.</p>\n<p>Sincerely,</p>\n<p>Corinne Lengsfeld, Interim Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor</p>\n<p>Uttiyo Raychaudhuri, Vice Provost for Internationalization</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 03, 2020","title":"Community Update on Coronavirus: April 3, 2020","tags":null,"link":"https://www.du.edu/news/community-update-coronavirus-april-3-2020"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"4faf39e5-6e19-51ff-9b25-87baffb77203"}}}

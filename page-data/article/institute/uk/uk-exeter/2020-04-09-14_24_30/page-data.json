No evidence will be required to support either request. We will endeavour to ensure that any student who attempts to complete assessments this summer, will be able to progress to the award (if they are a finalist or Masters student) or progress to the next stage (if they are a non-finalist).</p>\n<p>We would urge you to consider carefully before applying for a deferral, and to talk any such decision through with academic tutors and your family and friends. You can also seek support from the advice teams in the <a href=\"https://www.exeterguild.org/advice/\">Students’ Guild (Exeter)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.thesu.org.uk/advice/\">Students’ Union (Cornwall)</a>.</p>\n<p>In order to allow you to think this through carefully and in the light of what happens over the next few weeks, you have until Friday 1st May to make a request to defer all of your remaining assessments.</p>\n<p>Any student can apply for a deferral for <em>one or more</em> assessments where short-lived circumstances impact on your ability to complete some assessments but not others. No evidence will be required. Finally, any student can apply for mitigation or deferral should you experience technical issues or IT failure during an examination.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 31, 2020","title":"Examinations, Assessments, Progression and Awarding","tags":null,"link":"http://www.exeter.ac.uk/coronavirus/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3171f980-06f3-58fb-b088-08d931bd0c1d"}}}

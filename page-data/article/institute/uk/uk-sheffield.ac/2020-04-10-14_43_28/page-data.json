This will recognise the value of marks students have already achieved up to <strong>March 2020</strong> for assessed work. This means that no student who passes the year will receive an average mark or overall degree class lower than their current overall mark or degree class.  </li>\n<li>Government advice states that people <strong>must stay at home</strong> and should only leave for one of four reasons: shopping for basic necessities, including food and medicine, which must be as infrequent as possible; one form of exercise a day - alone or with members of your household; any medical need or to provide care for a vulnerable person; and travelling to and from essential work, but only where this absolutely cannot be done from home. <strong>It is absolutely imperative that staff and students adhere to this.</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Student travel home within the UK is no longer classed as essential</strong>. Students should remain where they are currently living and follow social distancing rules - see <a href=\"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus/faqs/students\">advice for current students</a> for more information.</li>\n<li>Staff carrying out <strong>business critical work</strong> that requires them to be on campus - where there is a significant consequence to health, safety and welfare if the work cannot continue - should have been notified and must carry a valid photo ID/UCard with them at all times.</li>\n<li>Stay at home for seven days if you have a high temperature and/or a new continuous cough. Anyone sharing your household will need to also stay at home for 14 days from when you first developed symptoms.</li>\n<li>The best defence to prevent the spread of coronavirus continues to be <strong>good hand hygiene practices</strong> and <strong>social distancing</strong>.</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 07, 2020","title":"Updated Tuesday 7 April 2020, 10:50am","tags":null,"link":"https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/coronavirus"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"0ea33fe1-56a3-5154-a5b8-72ce5606c9bf"}}}

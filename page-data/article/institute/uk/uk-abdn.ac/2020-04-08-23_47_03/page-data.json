We recognise the difficulties that some of you may have in completing further assessment at this time.</p>\n<p>While it is important that Honours and Postgraduate Taught assessment goes ahead, we are ensuring that the assessment will allow as much flexibility as possible so that you have the opportunity to do the assessment even in these difficult circumstances.</p>\n<p>Schools are working on the development of suitable alternative assessments where these are required and will be in touch with you in due course. As stated, we will ensure that assessment is as flexible as possible so that you are given every opportunity to complete the requirements for your courses.</p>\n<p>If for whatever reason you are unable to complete the assessments within the normal timescales, there will be an opportunity to complete the assessment at a later time without penalty.</p>\n<p>We know it is a difficult and uncertain time. Schools will be in touch with you soon so that we can create more certainty about your situation.</p>\n<p>Please keep me a look out for updates and FAQS on our coronavirus pages.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Karl and Ruth</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 26, 2020","title":"COVID-19 - Student Update - Levels 3, 4 & 5 assessment","tags":null,"link":"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/coronavirus/university-updates/13910/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"99200181-a9ca-5883-8d5a-9834be2814fa"}}}

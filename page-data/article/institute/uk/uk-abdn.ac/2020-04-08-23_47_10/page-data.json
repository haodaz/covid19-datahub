If you have already made payment of your accommodation fees, an appropriate refund will be made to you by our Finance Department. Please note that this will take time to action, but you do not need to take further action to receive this refund other than giving notice in the way described below.</p>\n<p>Please let me stress that this does not mean that University accommodation is closing. While some of you may have already moved out, there are many of you who are staying on, and I would like to reassure you that our accommodation remains open.</p>\n<p>For those students who wish to vacate halls and travel home now, the University has received advice from the Department of Education that returning home from accommodation is considered essential travel.</p>\n<p>So that we can make the necessary arrangements for those wishing to end their lease and those choosing to remain in University accommodation, we ask that all students in University accommodation complete this form.</p>\n<p>We understand that you may have further questions and we have tried to answer some of these here. If your question is not answered, please email coronavirus@abdn.ac.uk.</p>\n<p>We know that this is a troubling time, however we would like to ask that you bear with us during this extremely busy period, and please be assured that our teams are working hard to ensure all the required measures are put in place for both those choosing to end their agreements, and those who will be staying in our accommodation over the coming weeks.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Karl</p>\n<p>Professor Karl Leydecker</p>\n<p>Chair of Coronavirus Steering Group</p>\n<p>Senior Vice-Principal</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 24, 2020","title":"COVID-19 - Update for students with University accommodation contracts","tags":null,"link":"https://www.abdn.ac.uk/staffnet/working-here/coronavirus/university-updates/13898/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"b2278ad7-a3ee-5fee-8deb-a90e36153f3f"}}}

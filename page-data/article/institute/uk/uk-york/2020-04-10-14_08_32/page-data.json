In response I have made the following videos which I hope will help answer your questions:</p>\n<p>New guidance for online exams</p>\n<p>Importantly for many students returning next week you will be undertaking online examinations for the first time. We have written and published guidance and advice to help you prepare for what to do and how these exams might look and feel. Even if your exams are not until later in the term, it is worth reading the guidance now, so you will know what to expect.</p>\n<p>These are unsettling and difficult times for all of us and whilst we will not be able to welcome you back to campus in a physical sense, we are very much looking forward to engaging with you online at the start of the new term.</p>\n<p>Kind regards</p>\n<p>John Robinson</p>\n<p>Pro-Vice-Chancellor for Teaching, Learning and Students</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Coronavirus (COVID-19) updates","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk/update-messages-and-emails/tuesday-7-april-student-email"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"285ac7a7-4086-530b-b81d-cf7952df213e"}}}

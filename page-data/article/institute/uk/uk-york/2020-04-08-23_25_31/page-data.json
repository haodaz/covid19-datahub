Much of that has been felt so far in the changes we are making to our teaching. But there are also impacts on our research.</p>\n<p>As you may have seen, Research England has announced that REF2021 is now on hold, delayed until further notice. We are all very aware - and grateful - for the time already spent preparing for our submission.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the census date arrangements for REF have not changed and we will continue to work with UUK and the Russell Group to understand further the implications of the postponement and the plans for the rescheduled submission. Further information will be shared with relevant staff by the PVC for Research.</p>\n<p>Communicating support for students</p>\n<p>I also wanted to provide you with an update about some work we have been doing to look after our students, including some announcements of significant offers of support.</p>\n<p>First, and with enormous thanks to our very many generous alumni, staff, friends, and supporters of the York Unlimited philanthropic campaign, we have launched the Emergency Student Support Fund (COVID-19).</p>\n<p>This fund has been established to provide financial support to students with housing and food costs, travel expenses, technology costs associated with online learning and other unanticipated financial challenges. It provides support of up to £500 per student and details of how to apply will be widely publicised.</p>\n<p>Second, we confirmed that there will be no charge made from the start of the summer term for students with rental agreements with the University. This offer of early contract cancellation also includes students in Student Castle who booked directly through Accommodation Services.</p>\n<p>We have already encouraged as many students as possible to return to their homes, but for some this is not possible and our campus will therefore remain home to some students. We have reiterated to students that the Student Hub and College teams are available to support those remaining on campus, students who have accommodation contracts with private providers in York, or students with other particular requirements.</p>\n<p>Engaging our Prospective Students</p>\n<p>You will doubtless have seen many media reports on the potential impacts that the cancellation of public examinations may have on this year’s domestic admissions process. We are pleased that the Government has now confirmed that students taking A-Level and other final examinations will be able to progress to University this year. We have received very strong guidance from the Department of Education, OfS and UCAS that we must not try to amend existing offers, for example by making them unconditional offers. Our approach is different: to develop a range of ways to engage with our prospective students in a supportive way over the coming months. I shared a message to offer holders about how we will develop this support. You can see my video message to offer holders here.</p>\n<p>Building Closures</p>\n<p>Finally, you will have seen a message from the University Registrar &#x26; Secretary setting out guidance for the closure of most buildings on campus in order to protect frontline essential services: supporting students resident on campus, critical research (especially where it can help tackle the Covid-19 crisis) and essential maintenance. I urge you all to take seriously the need for the vast majority of staff to remain in their homes as per the Government instructions. This is above all to limit the potential for spread of the virus - and to protect our essential staff from that risk as they carry out their tasks. Thank you once again to those small number of colleagues who are remaining on campus to provide those essential services.</p>\n<p>I hope you are managing to stay well and that the additional constraints on remaining at home has not proved too difficult. Please look after yourselves and your families, especially now that many of you are balancing home-working and childcare.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Charlie</p>\n<p>Professor Charlie Jeffery</p>\n<p>Vice-Chancellor</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Wednesday 25 March: Staff and postgraduate research student email","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.york.ac.uk/update-messages-and-emails/wednesday-25-march-staff-and-postgraduate-research-student-email"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"e89f5795-58d4-5397-90db-35ec6a128289"}}}

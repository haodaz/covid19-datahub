Some of you will be taking timed online exams/assessments , in which case your school will supply more information. If you are taking such an exam, the time available will include time for downloading the questions and uploading your answers.

As a result, we anticipate that further adjustments will only be necessary in a very small number of cases.</p>\n<p>For those of you who are less familiar with the use of Moodle for assessment, there will be an opportunity to practise in advance. We will enrol you in a University Moodle site next week where you can familiarise yourself with paper formats and the means of uploading your completed exams and assessments. More details of this will follow, together with information from your school, which may be operating its own site to familiarise you with the specifics of its assessments.</p>\n<p>To reiterate the message we issued on Tuesday, we would like to reassure you that the University will be taking a ‘no detriment’ approach. More information about this approach will be provided as soon as possible. These are extremely difficult times for all of us and we know that the changes we have made to your exams and assessments will be challenging for you. We are taking every care we can to help you to complete the exams successfully. And finally, I wish you well in your preparations, appreciating that you are doing so in extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>Professor Jill Morrison</p>\n<p>Clerk of Senate and Vice Principal</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"Coronavirus: information for students and staff","tags":null,"link":"https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/news/coronavirus/updatearchive/headline_717636_en.html"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"228c3db0-e3e0-5681-91f4-85a37ff02956"}}}

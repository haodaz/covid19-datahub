These include Marshgate at the new UCL East campus in Stratford, where the contractor Mace has decided to pause construction, and the early enabling works for the major refurbishment of 20 Bedford Way (UCL Institute of Education).</p>\n<p>In addition, UCL decided to stop early enabling works and surveys as of 27 March on the site of the new neuroscience research facility at 256 Grays Inn Road. The contract for the main construction work on this project was yet to be signed.</p>\n<p>This is to protect the safety of all persons involved across UCL and our supply chains, conform to government advice and ultimately mitigate UCL’s financial exposure. Activities that can continue remotely are ongoing, including design development and procurement.</p>\n<p>Clearly, pausing activity will have an impact on the planned construction programme for these 19 projects. Until there is more certainty about the length of the lockdown in the UK it isn’t possible to confirm updated programmes. UCL Estates will work closely with the relevant departments to keep them updated of any further changes to construction activity and to notify other stakeholders. However, preparations for teaching and learning activity in these locations should continue as planned.</p>\n<p>Work has also been paused on all smaller improvement works and maintenance projects across campus, with the exception of projects that are currently in scoping or design stages.</p>\n<p>Vinci and Volker FitzPatrick, the contractors on the Pool Street West development at UCL East and the new Person-Environment-Activity Research Laboratory in Dagenham respectively have decided to continue work in line with government guidelines to ensure the health and wellbeing of workers.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 07, 2020","title":"Advice for staff and students who may have concerns about the outbreak of coronavirus","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/mar/advice-staff-and-students-who-may-have-concerns-about-outbreak-coronavirus"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d00224e5-8239-5fdf-ac42-22184e2a6f4d"}}}

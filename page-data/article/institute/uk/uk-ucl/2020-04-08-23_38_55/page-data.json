The university is adopting online alternatives for teaching and assessments wherever possible.</p>\n<p>Today UCL has confirmed that face-to-face teaching has been suspended for the remainder of this academic year and the university is moving towards delivery online wherever possible. In-person assessments scheduled to take place during the main exam period 27 April – 5 June 2020 will not now happen and will be replaced by online alternatives.</p>\n<p>These are extraordinary times and these measures are to make sure you can progress and succeed with your studies, and that our academic standards are maintained.</p>\n<p>Teaching for the remainder of this academic year</p>\n<p>UCL has decided today that all scheduled face-to-face teaching is suspended with immediate effect. We will deliver as much of this activity online as possible. This includes lab work for all undergraduate students. If you are a postgraduate student, please discuss access to labs with your supervisor.</p>\n<p>Your teachers and professors are working hard now to get this ready for you, in the spirit of simplicity, fairness and generosity. Thank you for your patience while we put plans in place.</p>\n<p>Departments will contact you to outline new arrangements as soon as they have been confirmed, through their usual communication channels.</p>\n<p>Alternative assessments</p>\n<p>Assessments scheduled to happen in person (in classes, labs or exam halls) during the main exam period 27 April – 5 June 2020 will not now take place. Any in-class exams or tests organised by your department between now and the end of term will also be removed or replaced.</p>\n<p>For the majority of students, your Faculties and Departments will replace these exams with alternative assessments that you will be able to complete online.This applies to all forms of assessment for which you would normally need to be physically on campus. Any assessments which can be submitted online, such as coursework, will go ahead as normal with the same deadlines as currently advertised.</p>\n<p>Your teaching staff will be reviewing assessments. Any changes will depend on the type of course and modules you are studying. We will let you know more details as soon as we can, but please note that this may take several weeks.</p>\n<p>We strongly advise you to continue to prepare for your assessments by continuing with your studies and revision as normal.</p>\n<p>In some cases, assessment may be repaced with coursework, e.g. short projects. In other cases, your assessments will be similar to those you would have been expecting. For example, instead of sitting a question paper in an exam hall, you might be asked to complete exam-style questions at home under timed conditions, uploaded to Moodle. Your department will follow-up with further information and details of this as soon as they can.</p>\n<p>Your fellow students at most universities around the world are experiencing similar changes at short notice; UCL will be working with our global networks to ensure you will not be disadvantaged. We are also working with the relevant professional bodies to make sure that the assessment alternatives we offer meet their standards and requirements.</p>\n<p>Where you can find support</p>\n<p>We understand that this is an unsettling time and you will have many questions about this major change. Thank you for bearing with us while we work through all of the challenges, but be assured that we are working to support your progression appropriately, fairly and safely, while maintaining the academic standards that make UCL awards so respected and valued.</p>\n<p>If you are worried about your studies or you feel you need help managing these changes, please contact our student enquiry system askUCL.</p>\n<p>Please continue to check UCL's main coronavirus webpage for accurate and updated advice about the coronavirus and UCL’s response.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 13, 2020","title":"Changes to teaching and assessments in term 2 and term 3","tags":null,"link":"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/2020/mar/changes-teaching-and-assessments-term-2-and-term-3"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c3156778-2b78-547c-800d-fcd287516914"}}}

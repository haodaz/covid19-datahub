Due to increasing travel restrictions and the need to reduce movement of people in the foreseeable future, we are urging all students who have access to an alternative safe and secure source of accommodation to vacate UCL halls of residences.  </p>\n<p>As this an unprecedented situation, it is hard to predict how long we will be advising students to study remotely for. However, it looks probable that we will not be able to offer teaching or other learning and assessment activities onsite for the remainder of this academic year. </p>\n<p>We are very sorry that the coronavirus pandemic is having such a far-reaching impact on our students, and that it is creating financial and logistical challenges that are not easy to resolve. If you are worried, I encourage you to speak to your family and friends, or use the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/students/support-and-wellbeing/wellbeing\">mental health and wellbeing support</a> available for UCL students.

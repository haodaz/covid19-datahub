This letter has collected over 500 signatures of final-year students.</p>\n<p>University response to final-year students open letter</p>\n<p>23 March 2020</p>\n<p>Dear students,</p>\n<p>Thank you for your letter.</p>\n<p>The COVID-19 crisis is an unprecedented event in our history. We understand that it is the source of a great deal of anxiety for many people, for many reasons. We empathise with the uncertainty, unpredictability and shadow it is casting over your lives and across the world and we sympathise with you as final year students. We understand that you are particularly concerned about the impact of the current situation on your well-being and on your studies. We appreciate you putting these anxieties on paper and proposing solutions. These are times for quite inventive thinking.</p>\n<p>We are keen to respond to the main issues you raise and provide the rationale for decisions we are making in good faith for final year students. We are aware that you too are petitioning in good faith. We do need to balance listening to your demands with considering the differing views of final year students. We also need to balance listening to you and being sensitive to all students’ well-being in the crisis with ensuring that your degrees and outcomes will hold worth. Our absolute priority is that you can complete your degrees within the academic year.</p>\n<p>Here is our response to the issues you have raised:</p>\n<p>Missed teaching</p>\n<p>Your lecturers are busy preparing a further four weeks of online teaching after April 20th and we have added a week after the Easter vacation to compensate for time lost before Easter. Your letter mentions that you only have five weeks of taught material for TB2; those students affected by industrial action will have had at least nine weeks of teaching before the summer assessment period, while all the others will have had 12 weeks of teaching.</p>\n<p>Online teaching</p>\n<p>Your lecturers are prioritising preparing online teaching for TB2. We appreciate that some students may find the transition to online education difficult at first, but our advice is to engage with the experience and try to gain as much as possible from it. The Digital Education Office at Bristol is making massive efforts to strengthen the digital capability of our staff so that they can teach you well in the online environment. We are asking lecturers to plan for real time online tutorials and online contact with you during each week. Most of your classes will occur offline (not live, real time sessions)with structured tasks, reading and problems for you to work on in tandem with offline teaching. Where helpful, lecturers will use lecture capture from last year to help you get to grips with content, but we are asking lecturers to do more than this in their online teaching.</p>\n<p>Student well-being and mental health</p>\n<p>Student and staff well-being and mental health are our top priorities in these very challenging circumstances. In that context, we believe strongly that keeping education and assessment on track is an important source of structure, normality and focus. We also believe that we need to be proportionate, realistic and empathetic so our lecturers are setting alternate assessments which are designed to balance the circumstances with the desire to ensure that you get the opportunity to bring together your knowledge and understanding in conditions which do not exacerbate stress and anxiety. All exams will be open book. All will have longer time spans for completion. Your previous outcomes will be calibrated into the overall degree outcome. Most specifically,Education Services are working on a simple COVID-19 system for Extenuating Circumstances. A second assessment period will be arranged later in the year to take account of the high likelihood of many more COVID-19 Extenuating Circumstances.</p>\n<p>Accessibility and EDI issues</p>\n<p>We are very aware that some students will have connectivity issues, won’t have laptops, and that online teaching poses different challenges for equality, diversity and inclusion. We are working to ensure that no student will be disadvantaged by online teaching and assessment.</p>\n<p>Library resources</p>\n<p>Our digital library collection will continue to be available to you.</p>\n<p>Dissertations and supervisions</p>\n<p>Please be assured that dissertation supervision will continue in regular online meetings. Supervisors will be working carefully to understand where experimental laboratory projects and other empirical studies have suffered and will make suitable adjustments to take into consideration the context. We are asking Schools to ensure that submissions timescales are reasonable if dissertation topics have had to change significantly.</p>\n<p>Optional exams/essays and prior outcomes</p>\n<p>We have advised programmes to minimise assessment given the context. The idea of giving students a choice about whether to take an examination/coursework assessment or to accept prior outcomes is problematic. It would allow some students to graduate without evidence of integrating the final term’s work, while others taking the examination/course work have that evidence. Fundamentally the degree award would be different between those who opted out of a final assessment and those who opted in. This would raise questions of the comparability and fairness of awards. We need to ensure that standards have been met for us to award degrees. Finally, please be assured that your final academic outcome will not be disadvantaged by engaging with assessments taking place under these contingency arrangements. It can only beto your advantage to engage with these. We are planning actions to mitigate the impact on students as much as possible and alongside that will run a streamlined Extenuating Circumstances process to capture the impact on individual students.</p>\n<p>We appreciate that none of this is ideal, and you may be disappointed with our response. We hope that you can see the reasoning for the decisions we are taking,and you are able to trust that we are doing this in what we believe to be your best interests.</p>\n<p>With best wishes</p>\n<p>Professor Tansy Jessop</p>\n<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Education</p>\n<p>Professor Sarah Purdy</p>\n<p>Pro Vice-Chancellor Student Experience</p>\n<p>Professor Hugh Brady</p>\n<p>President and Vice-Chancellor</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"April 08, 2020","title":"University of Bristol","tags":null,"link":"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/students/coronavirus/current-students/letter-response/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"9e7f0f2d-125f-52d9-91cb-aece6ee84572"}}}

The policy on video stream is available to download. If you prefer to postpone and rearrange your viva, we will be happy to support this.  In addition, we are moving to online thesis submission only.  Theses should be submitted via GRAD as a PDF; bound hard copies are not required.  The date of submission will be recorded as the date that the PDF was uploaded to GRAD.  Once again, your Graduate School can provide advice and support on all these matters. </p>\n<p>If the current situation means that you are not going to be able to meet the deadlines for transfer submission or final thesis submission, please apply for an extension.  All such requests will be considered sympathetically.  Graduate Schools can advise, once again.</p>\n<p>International PGRs on Tier IV visas</p>\n<p>If you choose to return home, rather than remaining in the UK, we will of course continue to support you as well as we can. Although we have stopped international travel on University business on the basis that such travel might contribute to the spread of infection, travel home does of course have to be a personal decision.</p>\n<p>If you wish to return home, but will be continuing to progress your research and complete supervision meetings, you will need to complete a ‘Change of Study Location’ workflow in GRAD.  This is so that the Graduate School knows your whereabouts and can support you during this period.  Supervision meetings can continue as outlined above, and should be recorded in GRAD.</p>\n<p>If you choose to return home but will be unable to progress your research remotely and supervision meetings cannot continue, or if you require a break from your studies for personal reasons, you can take an authorised absence or a suspension of studies, both of which can be applied for using GRAD.  Your Graduate School can advise as to which is most appropriate in your particular circumstances.</p>\n<p>PGRs who teach</p>\n<p>If you are a PGR who teaches or demonstrates, please contact the module leader for the modules on which you teach for advice in the first instance.  FAQs are being prepared and will be available on the coronavirus website. We ask for your patience while the website is updated.  PGRs will be paid for classes which they are scheduled to teach but which do not now take place.</p>\n<p>If you become unwell…</p>\n<p>Should you become unwell, please follow the advice on the university’s website regarding self-isolation.  You can also find sources of support there.  If you are unwell, we do not expect you to continue to progress your research or continue with supervision meetings.  Please complete the ‘Authorised Absence’ workflow in GRAD to inform your Graduate School of your absence. </p>\n<p>In conclusion</p>\n<p>We are committed to supporting you to continue with your research degree studies and to ensure that your work is not adversely affected by the current situation.  However, we recognise that for some PGRs it will be necessary for you to either work remotely or take a break from your studies, and there are a number of ways in which we can support you to do this.  Please do get in touch with your Graduate School or with the Doctoral College if there is anything more that you need to know.  Your safety and wellbeing are our priority.</p>\n<p>Best wishes</p>\n<p>Claire Honess,\nDean of Leeds Doctoral College</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"March 18, 2020","title":"Email to all postgraduate researchers sent 18 March","tags":null,"link":"https://coronavirus.leeds.ac.uk/student-advice/student-communications/"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3dec55d3-e993-5d6b-b22c-0652bddfa2c7"}}}
